By providing an inspiring, easy-to-use app where one can find artisans who specialise in reworked fashion, UpGarm strives to shift the fashion industry towards circularity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the fashion industry is the second biggest polluter in the world. We have enough clothing to supply the next six generations of the human race, yet items of clothing are worn only once or twice before being discarded and replaced. Discarded items typically end up in landfill, occasionally are down-cycled into rags for industrial use, or at best resold in charity shops. In a world where clothes are mindlessly produced and consumed in unsustainable quantities, produced by an industry that exploits the planet and people, it is high time for radical change—one that UpGarm strives to bring.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the UK, we produce 350,000 tonnes of waste per year. This is not only a wake-up call to our inconsolable habits, but also a source of immeasurable possibilities and potential. To quote Michael Braungart, we must see “waste as food, as a nutrient for what’s to come.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>“By providing an inspiring, easy-to-use app where one can find artisans who specialise in reworked fashion, UpGarm strives to shift the fashion industry towards circularity”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To properly address the issues at hand, our constant need to buy more, whether from small businesses, or big, needs to change. We need to start to look inwards, at the waste we have already accumulated, rather than outwards at what more we can consume. To truly be conscious consumers we must think creatively about what we already have. The fashion industry, as it stands, is monopolised by a handful of large brands and corporations who own the majority of the high street. Low prices and frequent new collections encourage shoppers to buy mindlessly, ignoring who or how the clothes are made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, things do seem to be changing. Since the lockdown in March, people are becoming much more aware of the social and environmental problems created by the fashion industry. Campaigns such as #PayUp and <em>I made your clothes</em>, as well as the call to boycott BooHoo, have made many more people aware of the current issues at play. ‘Sustainable’ fashion is gaining traction. People are starting to care about where their clothes come from, who made them, and how to reduce their carbon footprint.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the pandemic, shopping locally and from small businesses became a way to show one’s solidarity, or to help out in the community. However, the more one delves into these issues, the more it becomes evident that shopping at so-called ‘sustainable’ or small brands is simply not enough.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>“We need to start to look inwards at the waste we have already accumulated, rather than outwards at what more we can consume. To truly be conscious consumers we must think creatively about what we already have”&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The future of fashion is about reducing consumption and waste while championing circularity. UpGarm is not just another second-hand marketplace. Not only will buyers be able to find beautifully crafted items made from ‘unwanted’ materials, but the app will provide buyers with the option of having their existing items reworked or request a custom piece.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All materials have longer lifespans than many people typically think. Clothes should be reincarnated several times before they are considered unwearable. There are endless possibilities to reuse the clothes we leave at the back of our wardrobes. Through UpGarm, with access to a whole host of talented artisans, old, tired denim jackets can be transformed into a wearable piece of art, and old work-shirts into summer dresses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>UpGarm is for those who prioritise the planet just as much as they do their self-expression and creativity. It is a place for those who want to disrupt the system and re-evaluate what it means to enjoy fashion. UpGarm prides itself upon three core values: respecting the planet, embracing uniqueness, and being disruptive. The platform plays a key role in the movement to reduce consumption, fuel creativity, and shift our mindsets from quantity to quality. Follow their Instagram here, keep an eye out for the launch of the app and join the UpGarm community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>“UpGarm is for those who prioritise the planet just as much as they do their self-expression and creativity. It is a place for those who want to disrupt the system and re-evaluate what it means to enjoy fashion”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the founder of Re_considered, one of the artisans who features on UpGarm’s platform, I am most excited about how the platform will help me connect with people out there who want their clothes reworked and rejuvenated. Yes, it is a space to showcase and sell my already reworked items, but the opportunity to streamline the bespoke upcycling service is what is most important. I am passionate about providing an upcycling service to help people address their existing waste and unworn, unwanted items that sit at the back of their wardrobes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an artisan, and someone genuinely interested in shifting perspectives on consumption, I couldn’t be more excited to be part of UpGarm’s platform. Founders, Annabel and Mikey, are equally as impassioned about truly making a difference to how we shop, but also about making conscious consumption accessible and available to everyone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Sustainable” fashion has for a long time been a luxury, too expensive for the mainstream consumer. What resonated most with me about UpGarm was their pledge to redefining ‘luxury’; from an expensive commodity, to simply something unique to you. Join UpGarm and their artisans on their mission to radically shift perspectives on fashion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>“What resonated most with me about UpGarm was their pledge to redefining ‘luxury’; from an expensive commodity, to simply something that is entirely unique to you”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>By Tabby Bunyan </em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/tabbybunyan/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b4aefc3eada0425fa3eb5ac4dc00822a?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Tabby Bunyan\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/tabbybunyan/\">Tabby Bunyan</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex, 23 (who goes by Sebb Masters) and Will, 24 are both upcoming musicians from London. The two combined their eclectic skills during the summer of lockdown last year to create their next single ‘Closer To You’. I had a chat to them about their new release and got to know a little more about them in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Will</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Will, how did you react when Alex sent you the lyrics for ‘Closer To You’?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I smiled. His lyrics have always excited me because there’s so much in them &#8211; he never wastes a single word. He sent it to me in what was a tough time for most people, and in a time when I personally was struggling creatively, and so to be sent a song of that quality from such a good mate just made me super happy for him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. How did you find the process of recording at home for ‘Closer To You’?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah it was fun! I was at home with some of my family over lockdown when I recorded it. Alex has got me involved in a bunch of his projects so we get how the other works and it’s always fun. He sends me voice notes and outlines what he wants from me and I always feel comfortable trying to add little bits to the melody or the phrasing. It was really cool seeing it all come together without any of us leaving our homes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Out of the songs you and Sebb have released together which would you say is your favourite?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ooh, that’s tricky…They’re all so good and Recreation is such a bop, but I honestly think Closer to You is my favourite. I just think he’s found a new direction that really works and sounds sick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Regarding mainstream music over the past 10 years would you say it’s improved or declined?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not by much, but I’d maybe say that the mainstream has declined a bit. I feel it’s the peripheral music that’s really great. The sub-genres of pop and the more obscure, underground electronic and rap music is what I personally find myself listening to a lot of. I guess it’s just that the trend of TikTok chart toppers kinda annoys me a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Current artist or musician you’re listening to a lot at the moment and why?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m listening to a lot of A.G. Cook and re-listening to loads of Beatenburg. Both are very different, but I stumbled across A.G. Cook recently and was just blown away by some of the sounds he’s able to make. His 2020 album 7G is split into 7 parts and all the songs on there just sound so different from each other, it’s awesome. I listened to Beatenburg a bit a while ago, but didn’t really listen to them properly. I haven’t stopped playing their 2014 album The Hanging Gardens of Beatenburg. Their lyrics and melodies are some of the nicest things I’ve heard in a while &#8211; every song makes me smile. So that’s nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Out of all the artists you admire whom would you say gives you the most inspiration?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Alex mentioned earlier, I don’t think anyone is more into The 1975 than I am so definitely them. Jeremy Zucker is another one as well. Both of them produce themselves and have really developed unique sounds for themselves. They’re both able to release hit after hit which is pretty cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. If you could change anything about the music industry what would it be?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially at the moment with there not being any live shows, I would love for there to be more money in streaming. I think it’s ridiculous that 1% of the industry is able to live off streaming and everyone else makes pennies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8. In 3 words how would you describe your sound?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dreamy. Pretty. Synths.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9. Best advice you’ve been given in regards to the music industry?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably just taking opportunities and networking. When I first started taking it all seriously, I was just sort of looking forward and thinking about myself. But super important people are around you, you just have to look up and take notice. You never know who you might stumble across that could help do your artwork, or produce for you or play guitar on a track or something. So yeah, be friendly and open to meeting people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10.Genre you’ve yet to experiment with but would like to?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shoegaze-y indie rock &#8211; I’ve always been keen to make something with lots of guitars and live drums, but i’m not really a guitarist and no nothing about drums. I’d love to make some proper authentic live band stuff. I just feel like it would be a nice switch up from all the electronic, computer stuff I’m making at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>11. Finally, where do you ideally see yourself with your musical career in 10 years time?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oof, big question… I would like to have found decent success with my solo career, done a whole bunch of live shows, and maybe some festivals, because I’ve only really done gigs when singing for Alex! I’m also really keen to set up an independent label that works with kinda obscure UK artists of all genres and styles, but mainly electronic music and rap, and I’d love to run events by the label and get all the artists performing live. So yeah, would very much like to be comfortable in both the artist and the management worlds. We’ll see what happens!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Lucy Adams </em></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/lucyadams/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5c6d50067fb9eb638927a42d1a56ab63?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Lucy Adams\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/lucyadams/\">Lucy Adams</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Does Gary Glitter deserve the vaccine? This question was raised by Piers Morgan on ITV’s This Morning and it fascinated me as a debate. The very notion that this even needs to be raised is a shocking indictment of our collective lust for revenge. Let me first say that Gary Glitter is a despicable and perverted paedophile who deserves to be in prison for the heinous crimes he has committed. However, the very idea that the government should be creating a priority list that includes the morality of its citizens based on their convicted crimes is a mandate for authoritarianism. In this period of time when many people are concerned that the government is using lockdown as a way to increase absolute control, it is absurd that we would then request that they withhold the vaccine based on their own morality criteria.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue here is that Gary Glitter has been utilised in a way that will draw people into agreeing that prisoners should be low priority for the vaccine. They have chosen a man so vile that it is hard to disagree with. However, where do you draw the line? Is it just paedophiles and rapists who should not receive the vaccine, or are murderers included in this immoral lineup of the damned? What about ex-convicts who have been released since committing these crimes? Or, to make this selection more simplistic, do we simply say all prisoners, no matter their age or condition, must be offered the vaccine after the rest of the population has been vaccinated?</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is estimated that the Coronavirus vaccine will only be effective if at least 80% of the country is vaccinated. This includes prisons where Coronavirus cases have increased dramatically over the beginning of the year, in line with the rest of the country. Prisons are not isolated places &#8211; officers travel in and out each day, prisoners are released on a daily basis across the country and they receive deliveries regularly. To write off the prison population as undeserving of a vaccine before the righteous population outside of the prison is a nonsensical self-sacrifice based on pride and intolerance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the Lammy Review of 2017 made it crystal clear that minorities are overrepresented in prisons. The BAME population represents 13% of the UK, yet they make up 27% of the prison population, with black men being 26% more likely than white men to be remanded in custody. Thus, to not include prisoners on the designated priority list assigned to age and health would be to further disadvantage these communities who are already sceptical of the vaccine due to a generational distrust in the government for these very reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it may seem as though I am getting sidetracked from Gary Glitter and the question at hand, this all feeds into a wider debate of sentencing, rehabilitation and punishment. The right-wing media use stories such as Gary Glitter receiving the vaccine before others who are more deserving as a way to perpetuate this idea that we need to ‘get tougher on crime.’ It is a slogan, that along with his xenophobic Brexit rhetoric, won Boris Johnson the election. If you read any right-wing tabloid there will almost certainly be a story such as ‘How London’s knife crime epidemic is putting terrified tourists off the capital’s hotspots’ or ‘Britain’s softest judges exposed,’ (both of which are, of course, from The Sun). Although Britain’s prison population has skyrocketed since the 1950s and sentences have increased dramatically, especially for knife-related crimes, there has been no decline in criminality, in fact, quite the opposite. Thus, one must conclude that getting tougher on crime and criminals perhaps does not work and we should instead be focusing on rehabilitation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To the east, we have a multitude of examples of rehabilitative justice systems where rates of recidivism are extremely low such as Norway which has a rate of about 20%. On the other hand, to our west, we have a damning example of where our criminal justice system is heading. A May 2018 U.S. Department of Justice report on state prisoner recidivism found that of prisoners that were released about 68% were arrested within three years, 79% within six years, and 83% in nine years. Reducing crime is, evidently, not a matter of punishing criminals but instead rehabilitating them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To say to a prisoner, especially one who is vulnerable to the Coronavirus, that we are not giving you the vaccine because of the mistakes you have made in your life, is to say you are worthless and no longer have a purpose in this society. The likelihood of that person reoffending is extremely high because once someone is made to feel useless, why would they then try and contribute to a society that has written them off?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The relinquishment of someone’s liberty after they have been convicted is the punishment, not the vengeful destruction of their soul, through being thrust into a drug-filled, violent maze of concrete walls and metal bars. Gary Glitter will most likely not see the light of day again, however, most prisoners will, and it is fundamental they return to society rehabilitated rather than further criminalised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do not give every criminal a life sentence because everyone can change. Should an injured criminal on the side of the road be given medical attention? Yes, of course, because no matter the history of that person’s life, they are entitled to the same level of health care as everyone else. It is for this same reason that we cannot write off prisoners as less worthy of receiving a vaccine because it would set a dangerous precedent for the ways in which the government could use Coronavirus and the vaccine to extend authoritarian control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To conclude, I would like to mention Jack Merritt, the young man who was stabbed to death during the London Bridge terror attack in 2019 after leaving a prisoner rehabilitation event. After his death, his father said, &#8220;Jack lived his principles; he believed in redemption and rehabilitation, not revenge… we know Jack would not want this terrible, isolated incident to be used as a pretext by the government for introducing even more draconian sentences on prisoners, or for detaining people in prison for longer than necessary.” For a grieving father to say this with such fortitude after the gruesome death of his son is a testament to his son’s life and cause.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, in order to eradicate incidents such as these and to prevent inspiring people like Jack from being murdered, the answer is not writing prisoners off, increased sentencing, and more prisons; it is rehabilitation and trust. The notion that a vaccine should be withheld from prisoners is a small issue within a much larger and far more tragic one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>By <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/maxcoleman/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Max Coleman</a></strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/maxcoleman/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7023fde74da06f2898eaf3492eb2da99?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Max Coleman\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/maxcoleman/\">Max Coleman</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Here is a beginner’s guide for those of you who are wanting to customize some shoes. Whether you’re bored from lockdown, and looking to get creative, or wanting to start your own hustle, we’ve covered the basics, and all you need to know to get started is right in here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Where to begin?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This part can be the most daunting. Luckily for us, we do a lot of pre-planning. This way, there is less chance of messing up or making errors, and you have an idea of what your final design is going to look like.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great resource for beginners is <a href=\"https://kicksart.com/\">kicks art</a> it has a wide range of sneaker template which you can use to mockup designs. If you’re feeling confident and ready to dive in, then feel free to ignore this step! Otherwise, we recommend getting a template of the shoe you will be painting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For first-timers, we recommend a beginner’s kit that includes a variety of paint brushes, paints and most importantly, a deglazer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sneakerscience.co.uk/products/angelus-basics-starter-kit\">Angelus</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thefootwearcare.com/products/copy-of-premium-shoe-cleaning-kit-by-the-footwear-care\">The Footwear Care</a> offer reasonably priced starter kits with black, white, blue, yellow and red paint, a preparatory deglazer and a set of brushes in different sizes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>Preparation&nbsp;</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is deglazing and why is it important?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A deglazer is a preparatory chemical that is necessary to remove any dirt or grease from the shoe, as well as additional paint layers, that have been applied to it when it was being made in the factory. Removing these layers will allow the paint you apply to stick to the surface so much better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deglazer is more suited to leather, so if you’re wanting to customise a suede, rubber or fabric shoe, do not use a deglazer! These types of material require different types of preparation, most likely just washing with soap and water and brushing off any excess dirt!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do you deglaze?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your shoe is dirty, you might want to give it a wipe down with a wet cloth or baby-wipe before deglazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the shoe is relatively clean, all you will need to do is add some of the chemical mixture onto a cotton pad and use the cotton pad to remove the first layer factory finish. Let it dry, it will only take a couple of minutes, and you’re ready to start applying for your design work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>The Process</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sketching</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if sketching isn’t your thing, again, feel free to skip this step.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But… sketching is the best way to ensure accuracy. A pencil is all you need.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tips:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Don’t press too hard, you might poke holes, scratch or distress the material or make an imprint that can’t be rubbed off entirely</li><li>Don’t worry about sketching intricate details, when painting, you can refer to your template or go by eye to add these later.&nbsp;</li><li>Don’t use pen as it can’t be rubbed off&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Masking</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Masking tape will probably be your best friend, especially if you’re painting the panels of the shoe. Masking helps with isolating areas to paint or not paint and gives you nice clean lines and cut ins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-24-at-11.45.39.png?w=640&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2379\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Painting</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now for the fun part.

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">We are currently facing the biggest child refugee crisis in Europe since WWII, and the government’s recent decision to close the door on unaccompanied child refugees has, quite rightly, sparked outrage amongst many. As children continue to flee war zones in search of safety, boarders across Europe are closing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what does this really mean?</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is an attempt to stop vulnerable children making the dangerous and potentially fatal journey with the help of smugglers, and to allow the UK to focus on resettling refugees legally and fairly, directly from conflict zones. Unaccompanied minors will only be allowed legal settlement in the UK if they have family members currently residing here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is no secret that the illegal border crossing routes that refugees take on a daily basis are incredibly dangerous and risky. While the number of illegal crossings and tragic fatalities have certainly declined in the last 5 years, people are still drowning regularly in the Mediterranean &#8211; an estimated 979 in 2019 alone. They drown in an attempt to reach Europe, a place they see as a beacon of hope, opportunity and as an escape from conflict and danger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chris Philip, immigration minister, claims that “protecting vulnerable children is a key priority for the government” but this change in policy leaves vulnerable children currently residing refugee camos alone and without the safe entry route into the UK. In 2019, the UK received more asylum applications from unaccompanied children than any other country in Europe, and this should surely highlight the need for the UK to be more empathetic and welcoming, rather than prompt us the shut out doors on the vulnerable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems that this should motivate us to show compassion, and drive us to help, but for many it incites the opposite and photographs of refugees in peril or deceased continue to plague our media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did the death of Alan Kurdi, the 3-year-old Syrian boy found washed up on a Turkish beach &nbsp;after drowning in the Mediterranean, not teach us anything? (picture inserted here)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of our government ‘protecting’ such children, it recently became apparent that they instead illegally detained 80 of them between <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/children-refugees-channel-detained-home-office-b1798100.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>April and September last year</strong></a>. As well as this, many public figures have offered up outrageous solutions and sparked hateful debate, such as India Willoughby, in a Trump-like manner, suggesting that we should erect barbed wire fences to stop migrants from crossing our boarders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over half of the world’s refugees are children In the last decade<ins>,</ins> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/11/10000-child-refugees-put-lives-at-risk-to-enter-britain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>more than 10,000 child refugees</strong></a> have attempted to reach the UK illegally. Britain has been the top resettlement country in Europe for the last half of this decadeand<ins>,</ins> after Brexit, the government are insisting they are working hard to implement a system that will focus on the resettlement of refugees that is fair and safe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In principle, the law regarding unaccompanied minors seems logical. It will hopefully decrease the flow of these children taking such risks and will allow the UK to focus on legal resettlement directly from conflict zones. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However it is also incredibly neglectful and dangerous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/child-refugees-legal-route-home-office-b1792353.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Philp told the Independent</strong></a> “we’re honouring our commitment to refugees who’ve been invited to the UK. But what about those children who are already waiting in European camps? What about the future children who will cross regardless? Unaccompanied children must be protected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A child who embarks on a life-threatening journey does not do so because of slight discomfort or a mere hope of a better life, they do it because they have to. They do it because the idea of that treacherous journey and their potential injury or death outweighs the incredibly traumatic existence, they have in their residing homeland. It is an affliction that many of us here in the UK cannot even begin to imagine, and therefore little of us attempt to understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while this reversal may decrease the flow of these children illegally entering the UK, and may even save lives in the process, many of these children will attempt this regardless. The only difference? They are now forced to take on dangerous routes to enter the country, rather than applying for settlement. This is putting them at risk of human trafficking and further unimaginable horrors because of the UK’s lack of empathy for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are children. Young, unaccompanied children. And the government have passed the bill with no significant safety net or plan for them in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josie Naughton, co-founder and CEO of Choose Love said “leaving the EU could have been an opportunity to turn the UK into a beacon of human rights. Instead, it appears as if our Government is using it as an opportunity to turn its back on the weakest in society&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can the government not find a way to help resettle minors who have already arrived, rather than leave them at grave risk? Why can they not maintain the majority of these EU countries efforts to resettle these minors by providing them with legal routes? Brexit could have been the perfect opportunity for the UK government to show their commitment to unity and understanding. Turning our backs on lone children in EU camps does not seem like the right place to start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>By Bea Austin</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Like and comment on this article below</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/beaaustin/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bf1368b04b7f1636d68244a98ae2c909?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Bea Austin\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/beaaustin/\">Bea Austin</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Just before Britain officially made its European exit on 31<sup>st</sup> December, Vogue Business published an article titled <a href=\"https://www.voguebusiness.com/companies/brexit-is-here-what-next-for-fashion-luxury-eu-uk-tariffs\">‘What’s next for fashion?’</a> In it, Vogue Business data editor George Arnett detailed the absolute necessities for ensuring the industry’s survival in a post-Brexit Britain. Number one was ‘keeping zero-for-zero tariffs’. In other words, the tax on the movement of industry specific commodities between the UK and Europe should remain the same: zero. Boris, however, had other ideas.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually, Boris didn’t have ideas at all. In fact, there were no negotiations at all over the fashion industry pre-Brexit, a surprising discovery considering it’s worth £35bn and boasts one million employees in the UK alone. This was addressed in an <a href=\"https://www.fashionroundtable.co.uk/news/brexit-fashion-open-letter-to-government\">open letter</a> signed by over 450 influential figures from the British fashion industry to the government this week. Iconic British designer and darling of the industry Paul Smith estimated that the changes would cost his brand “multiple millions per year”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It recently became obvious to me how affecting this oversight has been on the small scale, too. I uploaded a jumper to social shopping app Depop and received a message from a woman asking me if I could ship to Denmark. I have never had qualms about international shipping if the buyer pays postage. So, I had a look at shipping costs through Royal Mail, whose website assured me that my knit could reach Denmark for around the £7 mark, even with tracking. I let my potential buyer know and she seemed happy. She would let me know the next day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, my lockdown vice is hours scrolling through various online shops, without any real intent to buy – effectively, virtual window shopping. I’ve definitely developed delusions of grandeur in terms of what I can afford to spend on an item and found myself obsessing over some metallic trousers from Danish brand Hosbjerg (purely coincidental – this article isn’t sponsored by Denmark). The trousers themselves cost about £100 new, but were sold out on the website. Knowing I could never afford them, I decided to torture myself further by searching on Depop (again, other shopping apps are available). The cheapest pair I could find in my size were £145. My interest was piqued. I messaged the seller to ask why they were so pricey – I understand they were sold out, but a 50% mark-up seemed steep/excessive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I accidentally bought two pairs” she told me, “and the import tax was £80. So, I effectively paid £140 for a £100 pair of trousers!” She told me that when she first made the purchase, she had absolutely no idea about the tax since it’s a post-Brexit development. For so long we felt safe ticking that T&amp;Cs box without actually reading the fine print, but Brexit complicates matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And my fellow online shopper is not the first to be surprised by huge import fees. The Financial Times <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9fb6b591-73cc-4bb7-815a-dc8eb8ad47dd\">reported</a> this week about EU customers buying woollen jumpers from the British knitwear brand Country of Origin. One customer’s jumper was classed as an animal product at customs, meaning that the buyer had to pay a €200 import fee. I like a good quality knit as much as the next person; against the backdrop of sweatshop labour and an ongoing climate crisis, we should strive to invest in sustainably sourced products that will last us for longer, whenever possible. But, with no disrespect to Country of Origin, odds are that most of us don’t want to pay £300 for a £100 jumper, even if it makes us feel like a paragon of ethical shopping standards. So, while I might not be able to afford an already hypothetical pair of trousers, the bigger concern is the survival of the British fashion industry, if the government doesn’t pull its finger out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, my buyer in Denmark got back to me. She was having reservations after remembering a friend recently having to pay extortionate prices for something from the UK due to, you guessed it, new import tariffs, and later confirmed that she couldn’t justify it. When I consider the personal frustration at losing one sale of one old jumper due to this political oversight, I can empathise with the British fashion industry, which is financially reliant on the exchange of goods and will struggle to stay afloat with these new duties. Designer Katherine Hamnett warned that ‘many firms could be weeks away from going under’, according to the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55894914\">BBC</a> this week. If I can’t shift my jumper, I’ll forgo a Deliveroo, but if Country of Origin can’t shift 30% of their stock (the amount they usually sell to EU customers) then they’ll be much closer to shutting up shop, meaning unemployment and potential financial crisis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I then had a peek at Zara and Mango’s UK sites, two prominent European brands that are now deeply rooted in the British high street. Their prices hadn’t changed at all – I even compared prices of garments in their Spanish branches to that of the same garments in the UK: no change. It comes as no surprise that such a transition has zero effect on fast fashion with its incredibly high yields at incredibly low production costs. Apparently, quality doesn’t outshine quantity when it comes to fashion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the upcoming weeks, all we can hope is that the letter has the desired effect and the industry’s demands are met. It seems prudent for the government to shoot their best shot to save an industry which can still thrive during a pandemic that has so profoundly affected most sectors. Of course, defending our fishing territory was a perfectly viable reason to deploy no less than four navy ships in case of a no deal Brexit, but did Boris think about the potential cost of sourcing a new ill-fitting suit if he made no negotiations over the fashion industry?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, while we wait in hope that the sector will emerge from the post-Brexit wreckage, we should strive where possible to spend on British brands, until the day that EU citizens are once again proudly purchasing British knitwear, and I can imaginary-buy my dream trousers without a silly import fee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Affordable British brands can be found&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.co.uk/british-clothing-brands\">here</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>By Katie Ross</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Rate and comment on this article below</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/katieross/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e3e64a255e5933c1573b92e22e2c1a90?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Katie Ross\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/katieross/\">Katie Ross</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

The stereotypes regarding the ‘Millennial generation’ and ‘Gen Z’ are countless. Apparently, we spend all our time dabbling in veganism and trying to make it as an Instagram influencer. Although the tendency of young people to engage in the latest fad is often viewed by many as being somewhat pretentious and frivolous, it does demonstrate the open mindedness of the generation to challenge their belief systems and see things from a different perspective. Putting aside the rich collection of stereotypes teaming with avocados and quinoa, it is a simple fact that young people will be shaping the world we live in, for better or for worse, and it is negligent to view them simply as an idle generation. History has shown us, time and again, the impact that young people have on our world. Game changers like Greta Thunberg, Emma Gonzalez and Malala Yousafzai (aged 17, 20 and 23, respectively) have played a key role in tackling some of the world’s major issues — namely climate change, gun crime and women’s rights. Similarly, Hasib Hussain, Germaine Lindsay and Marwan al-Shehhi (aged 18, 19 and 23, respectively) changed the world when they detonated their suicide jackets on the London Underground and guided a Boeing 767 into the South Tower of the World Trade Centre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"335\" height=\"278\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/greta.jpeg?resize=335%2C278&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2355\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/greta.jpeg?w=335&amp;ssl=1 335w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/greta.jpeg?resize=300%2C249&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Greta Thunberg</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e22a\">A lot of the world’s ever-present issues stem from hatred — humanity’s most dangerous learned behaviour. Jeanne Calment, from Aries, France, is known for being the oldest person in documented history with a lifespan of 122 years and 164 days. Using this as a conservative upper limit, that means that the human population completely refreshes itself at least every 122 years and 164 days. Prejudice and hate, however, exceed the limits of a human lifespan. As much as we young people may claim to never judge a book by its cover, we all inherit subtle prejudices that have cascaded down the generations, either getting diluted or concentrated by key events along the way. The reason why these prejudices persist is aptly highlighted by the famous idiom ‘<em>there is only one past, but many versions of history</em>’. Most of us will go through life having only heard one, unchallenged narrative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"21d7\">Being a Millennial myself, watching the news has always been quite confusing. Although many of us may prefer to live within the comforts of our own echo chamber, rarely challenging our views or bothering to learn about things that don’t appear to have any effect on us, most will still be familiar with the omnipresent themes in the news. These include, but are not limited to, racism and inequality, poverty in Africa, the crisis in the Middle East, terrorism, and tensions between the world’s superpowers. If we watch the news for 30 minutes today, we may have a vague idea about the current state of the world. We may even be able to have a somewhat informed conversation about Brexit with our barber. Tuning in to world affairs without a decent grounding in history, however, is sort of like starting to watch a TV series 13 minutes into the third episode of season six. Furthermore, history is complex. This TV show isn’t Friends or Family Guy, it’s Game of Thrones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"478\" height=\"337\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gameofthrones.jpeg?resize=478%2C337&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2356\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gameofthrones.jpeg?w=478&amp;ssl=1 478w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gameofthrones.jpeg?resize=300%2C212&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Game of Thrones</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that all of these issues are important enough to occupy most of our prime time newscast, it’s confusing then, that the history pertinent to these issues is not particularly well explored within the school curriculum. Every British school child will have learnt that the Romans built our roads, and they will be able to robotically recite the fate of Henry VIII’s six wives, however, there is little or no mention of the British Empire — a historical colossus that goes a long way in explaining the demographics of our country and the roots of various ethnic tensions. Our only exposure to Africa may be the odd WaterAid advert which paints a bleak picture of a disease-riddled continent with scarce resources. It was never explained to us that Africa is the richest continent in the world, in terms of natural resources, and that the Europeans ‘scrambled’ to slice off a piece of this lucrative cake to satisfy their rapacious appetites. Pretty much every day, for the last several decades, the news will have some feature about the issues in the Middle East. The ill-informed Millennial should be forgiven for viewing this region as a dusty wasteland overrun by terrorists and despots. It was never explained to them that Mesopotamia (modern day Iraq, Syria and Turkey) was home to the world’s earliest civilisation and that the region has spent more of recorded history as a prosperous trading area than a barren warzone. Anti-Western Islamic fundamentalism is often given a lot of attention, however, there’s a tendency to view terrorists as psychopathic mass murderers which overshadows our ability to consider, for a moment, the forces that are driving young people to commit such atrocities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"6e38\">We see Donald Trump’s tweets engaging in online trash talk directed at Russia or North Korea, somewhat akin to an 11-year-old lashing out after conceding a 93rd minute winner on FIFA 20. Some of us may learn about the Cold War at school with some mention of key proxy wars in Korea and Vietnam, however, we do not learn about the covert operations run by various superpowers to tacitly tug at the puppet strings of the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"313\" height=\"324\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ragequit.jpeg?resize=313%2C324&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2357\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ragequit.jpeg?w=313&amp;ssl=1 313w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ragequit.jpeg?resize=290%2C300&amp;ssl=1 290w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Rage Quit</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"6146\">The recent popularity, amongst young people, of books that shed light on major issues, such as race and class, is testament to their curiosity and determination to better understand their world. Many of these books, however, are a confronting read. The issues covered are, understandably, very personal to the authors and readers are encouraged to engage in difficult conversations that are all too easily sidestepped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"838d\">My life story is far from unique. I was raised in Norwich as the son of first generation immigrants from Sri Lanka. My parents are doctors, I was privately educated and lived an idyllic middle class life in a detached house surrounded by farms. I have since become a doctor myself, after a wonderful six years at Imperial College London. I never faced any major adversity, and I was never discriminated against. So, none of the issues I explore in this series of articles are particularly personal to me. Nonetheless, I am exactly what you, the reader, are — a young person wanting to make more sense of the world that we live in. I have written these articles whilst working as a junior doctor during the coronavirus pandemic. If any positives can be gleaned from the pandemic, it has shown that mankind is capable of putting aside their differences when confronting a common enemy. It has created a global sentiment of camaraderie in a species that has spent much of history fretting over our differences. It has made us acutely aware of our own mortality and it has emotionally primed us to understand each other a bit better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"fb6d\">This series of articles is intended to be an introduction to the historical context of current major world issues which, I hope, you will go on to explore in further detail. Above all, I hope that these articles will enable you to switch on the news, make sense of the content and be more understanding of the viewpoints of those that you previously disagreed with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"a452\">Young people, the world is in our hands. Let’s get to know it a little better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>By <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/lasithranasinghe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lasith Ranasinghe</a></em></strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/lasithranasinghe/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4816fcc8e0736188cd9fd7d6a3c3cc07?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Lasith P Ranasinghe\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/lasithranasinghe/\">Lasith P Ranasinghe</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Killer whales, Humpback whales, common dolphins, Risso’s dolphins, they all live and thrive around the island we call home.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not only the wildlife that&#8217;s impressive. Our islands are actually also home to some remarkable landscapes. Beyond the reaches of the southern Scottish midges, the northern coasts and isles of the UK boast white sandy beaches and palm trees, with an appropriately warm summer high of 15 degrees celsius. Scorching. Jokes aside, these places are extremely underrated adventure destinations which can be explored so close to home.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not all rosy out there in the ocean though. After years of reckless consumptive behaviour, we have managed to create quite the storm for the wildlife living there from the impacts of pollution and climate change. This boiled over in 2016 especially, when one of a pod of only 8 unique killer whales living on the West Coast of Scotland washed up dead on one of those previously mentioned tropical beaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/whale.png?resize=640%2C426&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2340\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/whale.png?w=939&amp;ssl=1 939w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/whale.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/whale.png?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/whale.png?resize=693%2C462&amp;ssl=1 693w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/whale.png?resize=150%2C100&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The whale, Lulu, was tangled in a fishing line with her blubber found to contain 100x the safe limit of a chemical found in electrical components, PCB, which had leached into the environment. PCB is the likely culprit for the pod’s infertility, and the nail in the coffin of their extinction, as they are unable to interbreed with other distinct groups of killer whales.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m sure I won’t be the only one surprised by this fact, or the fact that we actually have native killer whales in the UK, but hearing about it makes me want to do something for our seas and coasts. Fortunately, there are many charities out there working to protect and conserve our oceans, and the Hebridean Whale &amp; Dolphin <a href=\"https://hwdt.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Trust</a> are one such charity I discovered doing just this. Based out of Tobermory on the Inner Hebrides, they work to monitor our seas for marine mammal activity and educate the public on the lives of these ocean stewards. Over the last 20 years they have covered over 100,000 square kilometres through their annual surveying trips!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all this in mind, I wanted to create something which raised awareness for these animals and showed the best of these places &#8211; nature, landscapes and people alike &#8211; to do some good for our environment. So I created an adventure race, the Selkie. Hailing from old norse-gaelic mythology, the Selkie were creatures which were known to climb onto land and shed their seal skin to turn human. Much like what these creatures were capable of, the race spans a series of islands, and involves swimming, running and biking all the way from one end of the chain to the other. (Biking is the 21st century Selkie-spin).</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Selkie race equates to a channel swim, iron man bike and double marathon, but on the ground (and in the sea), it is several degrees colder, with far more deadly jellyfish and howling gales.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"881\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hib.png?resize=640%2C881&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2338\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hib.png?resize=744%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 744w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hib.png?resize=218%2C300&amp;ssl=1 218w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hib.png?resize=768%2C1057&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hib.png?w=935&amp;ssl=1 935w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The race covers a total of 180 miles across the entirety of the Outer Hebrides. Beginning at the lighthouse on the southernmost Isle of Barra head (Berneray), the first leg crosses four sounds and 4 isles totalling 7 miles of swimming. During rough storms, small fish have landed atop the 193m sea cliffs on the first isle, Berneray, whilst the second isle of Mingulay, at 273m, has been known to lose sheep. In Gaelic, the southern tip of the third isle, Pabbay is known as the nose of the strong tide, and if missed will not be made. Once successfully over to the fourth isle, Sandray, it is a short plunge over to Vatersay, before a 15 mile run takes me to the next swim &#8211; 6 miles over to South Uist.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Uists (Indicated by the red lines) are pretty flat and very low-lying, looking more like a swamp than islands from a map. These will be a 60 mile bike across and could be a world record or a serious challenge depending on the whims of the wind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final swim across the Sound of Harris is also the longest single swim leg, at nearly 7 miles. Once up to Leverburgh, it will be a 52 mile bike over Harris and down onto Lewis. Here I will find the final 36 mile run to the Butt of Lewis lighthouse and the end of the selkie across the open moors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Training for this race is brutal, and right now during lockdown involves swimming in the dark in the North Sea in sub-zero temperatures before work, taking to the indoor trainer at night and running whenever I can. As much as I miss the warm pool and the ability to do longer sessions and drills, sea training is essential given the average Hebridean sea temperature being a fair bit lower than the channel. Even with the wetsuit and (veggie) goose fat I will need to build a solid cold tolerance base as well as a fitness base. Before this lockdown I was peaking at around 15 hours of training, and I will be aiming to more than double that as the race draws closer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in the wildlife, the training, or the race itself, give me a follow on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JamesArmourr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">facebook</a> or <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jamesarmour_/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">instagram</a> where I share mostly daily updates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anything you can do to support would be massively appreciated and pull me through some of the training that’s going down right now.

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I want to start by making it clear why I am writing this piece and what I am trying to achieve in doing so. Over the past few months a bright light has begun to illuminate the various ways in which race and the issue of racism permeate every sector of our society. As a result of this, I have set about to reflect upon the role that race has played in my life as a young black man.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To give some context, I was lucky enough to attend Dulwich College, a fantastic private school, from the ages of 7 to 18. Hence, I believe that I can give unique insight into the way in which racism has manifested itself in the private school system. I cannot speak to the experience of all black people at every private school in the country, or even at Dulwich College, however, I do believe that many of us have similar stories to tell. Nonetheless, this commonality of experience does not guarantee a shared perspective on the issue, and so, I claim only to speak for myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This piece is not an attack on private schools, or Dulwich College specifically, but an attempt to highlight a wider issue that I believe needs to be addressed. I will begin by looking at the nature of the racism that I faced and then going through what I believe to be the root causes behind it. Finally, I will suggest what I believe are some potential solutions to the problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem of racism did not begin to rear its ugly head up until the age of thirteen &#8212; or rather, I was not aware of it until then. There is a veil of childish ignorance that protects you from such issues. However, from thirteen onwards, I experienced a veritable wealth of racially insensitive jokes and comments. Perhaps shockingly, most of the jokes came from friends of mine at the time, many of whom I am still friends with today. While I know that they are not people who subscribe to the ideology of black inferiority or white supremacy, it does not excuse their behavior at the time or make their comments any less racist. It points to how racism is becoming increasingly normalized. This could be seen as an even greater problem as I would argue that this kind of racism is more pervasive and harder to root out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To this day, two events remain particularly memorable to me. The first was a running joke that continued for many months when I was fourteen. A good friend of mine thought it funny to refer to me as “Coco the slave” while he pretended to be my “master”. He would caricature a Southern American slave owner while I acted as his slave, and we would laugh about it together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I focus on my own actions, my first question is: why did I play along with what I see now to be such a horribly racist and self-deprecating joke? I can make some assumptions based on hindsight but in all honesty, it is difficult to give a definitive answer, since my mindset has changed so much since then and it is near impossible to unlearn my current perceptions and moral compass.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps I did it to “fit in”. When we made this “Coco and his master“ joke it was met with laughs from other boys, and I think a large part of the reason why I allowed myself to be subject to such racism was that the people I was surrounded by found it funny. What does it say about the environment that I was in, that I felt that these were the kind of jokes that I needed to make about myself in order to fit in?</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It speaks to the toxic sense of humour and an overall obliviousness that comes along with a certain level of privilege.This is not to say that privilege breeds racist attitudes, but that privilege disassociates you from struggle and hardship, and as a result of this dissociation, people don’t understand the weight or the impact of their words. This again does not excuse such behavior, but points to a potential cause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This logic suggests that I allowed such jokes because of the environment that I found myself in. Self-deprecation and the acceptance of racism felt like the best way for me <strong>to fit in.</strong> Although I believe that there is most definitely some truth to that argument, I am not trying to portray a narrative of victimhood as I don’t see myself as a victim. I don’t think it is helpful for me to view my experiences just through that lens. Doing so does not allow one to have a full understanding of my experience. Looking back now one of the things I wish I had done was to stand up and not allow these kinds of things to go on. In keeping quiet I played a role in perpetuating casual racism by not only allowing it to happen but perhaps also by even encouraging it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second incident of casual racism that stuck with me was something that I experienced on a rugby tour the summer before I started my first year of A-Levels. This is one of the more harrowing racist experiences I faced. This is mainly due to the fact that I, and the boys who partook in the experience, were much older and thus more aware of the weight and gravitas of what we were doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the last day of the rugby tour, we were all given a bit of free time, and, as the younger year group at the time, we had to face some “hazing”. Essentially we had to do something embarrassing in front of all the boys as a rite of passage. Many boys had to do various different things, but my “punishment” stood out. For my initiation, a black friend of mine and I were told that we had to have a mandingo fight. A mandingo fight is depicted a lot in popular culture and is essentially when two slaves are ordered by their masters to fight each other to death for entertainment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, we didn’t have to kill each other, but we had to strip into our boxers, oil our entire bodies and wrestle each other while the other boys surrounded us to make up a ring, cheering us on. This again is evidence of the toxic humor that develops in these environments <strong><em>(private school environments??) </em></strong>but in this instance, it was arguably amplified by the “Lad” culture associated with rugby. Again, I want to be careful not to paint all “rugby lads” with a sweeping brush, as that would be unfair, but I also think it’s fair to say that “Lad” culture played some role in this experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is interesting is that a few of the older black boys present encouraged the fight as well, alluding to the normalization of this type of behavior. These experiences taken together show that it is difficult for a black man or woman to move past the colour of their skin in some instances. From my experience at Dulwich College, being black in certain situations was a part of my identity that was highlighted the most. This is not to say that this is inherently a bad thing. I am a proud young black man, but I am also many other things. My experiences of casual racism show that at times my amalgamation of various identities was simplified down to me just being black, and this was very belittling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, we arrive at the big question: how can and should this issue be tackled? I do not believe that casual racism is something that can be completely eradicated, as it is impossible to police what kids and young adults say in their free time. But there are two things that could potentially help alleviate the problem. First is to tackle what I mentioned as the dissociation from the concept of struggle. To do this schools like mine should encourage people of colour who have achieved great things in their respective fields <strong><em>(why must they have achieved great things?)</em></strong> to come back and give talks on the effects that racism has had on them and their life. Seeing someone in front of them who has personally been affected by racism could contextualise the issue for young students and encourage them to think twice about their own actions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another tangible policy would be an increase in the number of bursaries given out, especially targeted at some of the more impoverished areas of London. If minority groups gained more representation in these (private?) schools, people (of colour?) would feel more confident in standing up to casual racism. One of the biggest barriers to private schools is cost, and this has excluded minority groups within London as they earn on average less than the average white household. This does not mean that there aren’t incredibly bright children who deserve the chance to be able to go to these schools. A more aggressive bursary scheme is needed to combat these issues (institutional racism). These are just my own personal thoughts upon reflecting my experiences. I believe that there is a story here that needs to be told, and I have found myself in a unique position to tell it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>By Olisa Ikezue-Clifford</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Rate and comment on this article below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/olisaikezueclifford/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/563484e5bd5eb551145fbc21dd413dd8?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Olisa Ikezue-Clifford\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/olisaikezueclifford/\">Olisa Ikezue-Clifford</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">New lockdown trends continue to emerge as a result of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Whether it’s the forced family Zoom quiz, baking endless batches of banana bread or the late-night binge through Hinge or Tiktok, we all seem to have taken on at least one new fad. Yet not all of these time-fillers have positive impacts on our well-being (watching Grandma navigate FaceTime can indeed be agonising for us all). However, one craze that proves beneficial and continues to boom this lockdown is the addition of a new furry friend to the household. Especially canine companions, last year saw a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-54115646\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sharp increase</a> in puppy buying. The charity Dogs Trust <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d14541e-0c11-48bb-90a1-3f7dc05258a6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reported</a> that the number of people searching for dogs on their site had more than doubled in 2020, while visits to sites such as Pets4Homes were <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-54115646\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">peaking</a> at 20 million views per month between April and June.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Increased interest in puppy buying during the pandemic has happened for a number of reasons. Millions of people are now working from home or are on extended furlough, while children are again home-schooling which promises a perfect environment for a four-legged friend. Working parents can finally fulfil that once unattainable dream of a puppy joining the family, while those living alone gain companionship and a buddy to take with them for their daily exercise. Indeed, the therapeutic benefits of owning a dog are <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1289326/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">increasingly recognised</a> by researchers. Speaking to The Guardian, psychologist June McNicholas pointed out that pet-care and self-care are inextricably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/17/dogs-have-a-magic-effect-the-power-of-pets-on-our-mental-health\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">linked</a>: the owner is forced to leave the house, to exercise and to shop for food for their pet which in turn means they are more likely to feed themselves. This sense of responsibility and social recognition with a dog can be life-saving, especially among those who are isolated or depressed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The evidence of deteriorating mental health cannot be denied amidst the Covid 19 pandemic. It is thought that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/health-54616688\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">certain groups</a> are particularly prone to suffering, with women and young people at the forefront. Whilst young people are much less likely to become severely ill with coronavirus, the disruption to education and the impact of isolation on mental health continues to be a concern. An <a href=\"https://digital.nhs.uk/news-and-events/news/survey-conducted-in-july-2020-shows-one-in-six-children-having-a-probable-mental-disorder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NHS survey</a> carried out last July found that 1 in 6 children are experiencing a probable mental disorder, which is up from 1 in 9 in 2017. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/health-54616688\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Researchers</a> have expressed concern over the lasting psychological effects the lockdowns will have, effects that will sadly be disrupting lives long after the virus has diminished.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems as though deteriorating mental health has also played a part in this wave of sudden dog-buying. Puppies are an easy fix to boost morale, curb loneliness and encourage regular exercise. However due to the increased demand puppy prices have skyrocketed. The cost of a puppy has more than <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-54115646\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">doubled</a> since lockdown first began in March, with the most popular breeds now going for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-54115646\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">£3,000 or more</a>. The sad outcome of this demand is an unprecedented surge in ‘dognapping’, with UK dog thefts <a href=\"https://www.countryliving.com/uk/wildlife/pets/a35079962/uk-dog-theft-lockdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">increasing</a> by a whopping 250% in 2020. Criminals have been cashing in on puppies like never before, with female pups being the hottest target due to their breeding potential. The <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/e608d8aa-52ad-11eb-b5cf-1d37166171d9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1% likelihood</a> of dog thefts ending up in court (you will more likely receive a small fine or suspended sentence) does not do much to deter criminals from this serious money-maker. However the government are cracking down. Legislation such as <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/lucys-law-spells-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-puppy-farming\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lucy’s Law</a> have been introduced in the last year to try and put a stop to the cruel business of puppy farming. These squalid and unsafe farms subject bitches to repeated breeding, churning out high numbers of sick and traumatised puppies to sell for an excessive profit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have recently bought a lockdown puppy then do be cautious. Having a dog now may help you maintain balanced mental health, but losing that companion can be devastating. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-54372778\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Some owners</a> are reported to have suffered with depression, PTSD or anxiety as a result of thefts. It’s also essential, as Dog’s Trust say, to remember that ‘a dog is for life, not just for lockdown’. It’s important to consider the reality of not home-working forever, and whether you can continue to maintain a high level of care for your puppy after the pandemic. So go and get your dog chipped, keep them on a lead if you’re ever uneasy and make sure your garden is secure. We need to keep our canine companions safe as well this year!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>By <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/larakeville/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lara Keville</a></strong></em></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/larakeville/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76bbebf22b4349a8a5bf356f09eb45b5?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Lara Keville\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/larakeville/\">Lara Keville</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">At this moment in time, the notion of crowds in often a tendentious topic. Since the dust of the global pandemic has settled, our lives and habits have adapted to necessary measures such as working from home and social distancing. So much so that we often find ourselves in a constant state of turbulence whilst watching that new TV show or original film on Netflix – worlds apart from the one we are currently navigating – where fictional characters lead fictional lives without masks or lockdowns. With this in mind, I would like to draw your attention to the African American artist Archibald Motley. His stylised series of Chicago party-scenes – which includes paintings such as&nbsp;<em>Blues</em>, 1929 and&nbsp;<em>Hot Rhythm</em>, 1961 –promote the elation and vibrancy of the African American experience during the Chicago black renaissance. Paying close attention to Motley’s most celebrated work&nbsp;<em>Nightlife</em>1943, let us consider how he utilises the motif of crowds in order to promote community and escapism in defiance of social, political and cultural suppression.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within an initial glance at&nbsp;<em>Nightlife</em>, we are instantly exposed to the feeling of community. The artificial pink hue drenches the interior space of a blue’s bar which immediately establishes an undisclosed sense of unity. Our gaze intuitively gravitates towards the forming gap within the crowd – between the dancefloor and the bar – as Motley’s dynamic configuration implicitly summons us into the interior space of the buzzing jazz cabaret. The lit cigarette – that hangs from the hand of the nonchalant gentlemen at the bar – guides our visual curiosity deeper into the softly lit imagine space where the interconnected bodies of partygoers become indexical to the energy within the bar. The viewer is overcome by the rhythmic and infectious movement of the angular limbs, gleaming martini glasses and syncopated bodies. It is almost as if we can hear the Bepop from the omniscient jazz band playing somewhere beyond the crowd of revellers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon closer inspection into the historical context of&nbsp;<em>Nightlife</em>, we learn how the euphoric painting of pleasure-seekers dancing into the night clearly demonstrates escapist undertones. During the 1930s and 40s the neighbourhood of Bronzeville in Chicago was home to 90% of the city’s African American population who like Motley’s family moved North from southern states in search of economic opportunity and freedom from racism. Although they had escaped the unjust severity of racism in the South, racial prejudice was demonstrated through social matters such as strict housing policies. Nevertheless, the stylised black bodies portrayed in Motley’s&nbsp;<em>Nightlife</em>prevail from such racial discrimination. An act of true transcendence, it is as if&nbsp;<em>Nightlife&nbsp;</em>is suspended in time where the black partygoer’s triumph by endlessly and aimlessly dancing into the early hours of the morning within the solace of the jazz cabaret.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"191\" height=\"158\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/crowds-3.jpg?resize=191%2C158&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"2316\" data-full-url=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/crowds-3.jpg?resize=191%2C158&#038;ssl=1\" data-link=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/?attachment_id=2316\" class=\"wp-image-2316\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"202\" height=\"158\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/crowds-2.jpg?resize=202%2C158&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"2317\" data-full-url=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/crowds-2.jpg?resize=202%2C158&#038;ssl=1\" data-link=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/?attachment_id=2317\" class=\"wp-image-2317\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is undeniable that our timelines, newsfeeds and screens have been saturated with the negativity of crowds or their lack of. Far-right extremists storming the US capitol, antiauthoritarian protests in Russia against, Dutch protests against the implantation of a national curfew and the second cancellation of Glastonbury festival due to the Corona virus pandemic. However, alike the solace which the African American partygoers of Motley’s crowd paintings find within the imagined interiors of Chicago jazz bars, we too must remain mindful and find solace within the safety of our homes during lockdown. I would like to conclude by drawing our attention to a particular quote by Motley: “I feel that my work is peculiarly American; a sincere personal expression of the age and I hope a contribution to society.” Here, Motley signposts his desires for his artwork to contribute towards amending the racial segregation within American society. From our historical viewpoint, I believe that Motley’s crowd series demonstrate a newfound agency. As we currently stand within the UK’s third national lockdown, may the communal escapism of the African American revellers within Motley’s crowd series positively influence our society to transcend the gloom and suppression of lockdown; instead, may they function as visual reminders of more vibrant times to come in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Finlay Lander</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>Please like and comment on this article below!</em></strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/finlaylander/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a4d5c9364bfe39a5c54b53e1786c5432?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Finlay Lander\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/finlaylander/\">Finlay Lander</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

The two combined their eclectic skills during the summer of lockdown last year to create their next single ‘Closer To You’. I had a chat to them about their new release and got to know a little more about them in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. So Alex, am I right to believe you all recorded your own parts of your new single ‘Closer To You’ separately during May/June of last year? How was that?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, we did! I wrote the song in May, during the first lockdown and we were unable to all get into one room. There’s a line in the song that says ‘what happened to reading and writing, finding the small things exciting?’ and I think this last year has made me rethink how privileged we are to just be able to text people or call them when we want. In the past, it would’ve been letter writing (which I love, by the way). The reference to small things was that I feel as if lockdown has made us really appreciate going back to basics: reading, painting, even just going on a run, and those small things have given us joy, which is a small positive to come out of a very negative situation. That whole line sums up what I wanted to do with this song; have a big sound but also work resourcefully, appreciate how lucky I am to have these instruments and talented friends. Nick actually recorded his sax solo off his iPhone’s voice memos app and sent it via WhatsApp so it’s a cool reminder that even when we’re far apart, we can still make things work. A very special mention has to go to the phenomenal BROOKFIELD who brought this song together. He’s an epic producer, instrumentalist, singer and a great guy as well which obviously helps!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. What does your creative process look like when writing a song like ‘Closer To You’?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone has a different way of working, some people are relentless and will write 10 songs a week and within those songs will be one or two that they love whereas I’m quite inconsistent and only write if I have an idea in my head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. What inspired you to write it?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were all at home doing absolutely nothing but waiting for the world to re-open. Obviously, Covid-19 has been a terrifying experience and people have suffered terribly. A lot of people I know were struggling in May for various reasons. On a personal level, May was supposed to be an extremely special month for my family but our plans were postponed so I just wanted to write something that gave hope. I wanted to write a song about that feeling you get when it genuinely feels like life can not get any better, that feeling of euphoria and I hope that listeners get that energy when they play the song.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. How do you feel technology/the internet has impacted the music industry?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, without technology, this song wouldn’t be finished and without technology there probably wouldn’t be anywhere new for music to go. The internet gives a voice to unsigned musicians and although I don’t love TikTok, there’s no doubt it’s added another dimension to the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. When did you first write a song you felt confident enough to release?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the age of about 12, I wanted to be a singer but it took me quite a while to work out that I prefer writing for other singers so my first song that I wrote for someone else to sing was in 2017, it was called Telescope and I released it in May 2018. That was when I really began to believe that this project was something that I wanted to do. It’s a way to work with people, give others a chance to have their voice heard but I’ve got to say, it’s a really scary thing to do, releasing music. You put your soul on the line for entertainment, which is a strange concept, but hopefully people have related to my songs so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Which current musicians or producers inspire you the most at the moment?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bombay Bicycle Club just get it so right, they come across as a lovely group of guys and their music is so cool and different to anyone else. They give off the impression that they’re still just four friends living the dream, led by their unreal singer/producer Jack Steadman, aka Mr Jukes. In recent years, I’ve got very into The 1975, very much under the influence of Will and his borderline obsession with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Is your song-writing perfectly planned or more spontaneous?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Completely spontaneous, I’ve only ever sat down once to write a song with a group of people under time pressure and that was in August last year with my good friends Tom Katon, Fowler and Eliza Leng, they’re all ridiculously talented and that song should be out soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8. Favourite song you’ve written so far?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably Closer to you and my next song, which will be called ‘Wake me in the Morning’. It’s currently in the recording process and we just need to get some drums and vocals on there! It’s the sort of song I’ve wanted to write for years but just have never quite got the sound I wanted. Of all of my released music, I’ve got to say that recording the song ‘Building Bridges’ was probably the most enjoyable experience. My friend at university told me that her grandpa has a studio and he kindly let me use it with some singers. Throughout the day, he was unbelievably welcoming and charming and we had a great time getting to know him over some lunch and in the afternoon, he got involved in the recording process, so that experience makes me look back very fondly at the song. It was ludicrously hot that day, one of those weird English summer days where it decides to be about 400 degrees and clear blue skies and then rains for the next 2 months to make up for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9. Any advice for people who are aspiring singer- songwriters?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crikey. I’m not really in a position to give advice but I’m always willing to work with people who might want a second pair of ears.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10. Finally, what’s next for you and where would you be ideally in the next 10 years in regards to your music?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I’ve got a university degree to get through so that’s the immediate focus. In terms of music, I’ve got some plans this year which I’m keeping secret for the time being! In 10 years’, time, I hope I still love writing music as much as I do now, whatever capacity that may be in. I don’t know where I’ll be or what I’ll be doing but I think it’s important to always enjoy doing this.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Lucy Adams </em></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/lucyadams/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5c6d50067fb9eb638927a42d1a56ab63?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Lucy Adams\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/lucyadams/\">Lucy Adams</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

The birth of my curiosity stemmed from coming home after school and frantically looking for the TV remote to press 350. Before the days of recorded programmes, I would diligently schedule my day to watch each musical channel playing the latest hits and found excitement in catching my favourite song.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is here where I saw the creative process of how artists translate an auditory experience into the visual domain. How the two complement each other and where the video enhances a particular theme. As I have grown older my appreciation has grown where I pick up on the considerable attention to detail behind each and every object within the video. My love has further deepened when videos push the boundaries of creativity by centring a message and leaving the audience spellbound, inspired or simply providing a momentary respite from the ills of society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is within these moments where we catch a glimpse of the human possibilities visually displayed before our eyes. It calls upon us to tap into our creative mindset in order to find an outlet and show up as fully authentic. To honour our humanity as an offering to the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No doubt reading the comments under such videos and seeing a plethora of compliments highlighting how such representation makes them feel proud, seen, appreciated and celebrated. A creative antidote to the caricatures of blackness, sexuality, womanhood, manhood, childhood which constantly deprive black individuals of their humanity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just for you, I have selected a few calming, cathartic visuals from beautiful music videos which use themes of blackness to varying degrees; where blackness is centred or used as a thread to connect the multifaceted human experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Michael Kiwanuka &#8211; </strong>One More Night <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Sw2JJ5nSbM\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Sw2JJ5nSbM</a> This video is fun, trippy and carefree &#8211; filled with multiple visual effects.

However, in the 2020 election, Trump received the second most votes of any Presidential candidate in <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/11/06/2020-election-reveals-two-broad-voting-coalitions-fundamentally-at-odds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">history</a>, showing that American’s care more than ever before about politics, a result of the continuing polarization of ‘we the people’. The historic turnout in the 2020 election and subsequent Georgia run-off election shows just how salient identity politics has become. Often, election results suffer from widespread voter apathy, and many political campaigns over the years have consistently tried and failed to change this. In order for turnout to increase in elections, voters need to care enough to vote, and believe enough that it is important that they do. So, in the 2020 election, the fact that Donald Trump as the loser got more votes than any President ever (apart from Biden) shows just how historically significant the election results were for Americans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the US, a wide range of socio-economic and political issues are collapsed into two ideological lines under the umbrella of the two main parties, and partisan identity is more than just opinions about fiscal and monetary policy, it is also formed on the basis of fundamental ideological issues such as race and rights. As well as this, such a strong two-party system creates an environment, in which the winner-takes-all, and the loser-takes-nothing. This leads to a high stakes political environment in which the costs of losing an election are not just political for Democrats and Republicans, they are ideological. This has been hugely exacerbated by the rise of social and mainstream media echo chambers and divisive politicians such as Donald Trump into the mainstream, resulting in a fundamental shift in the core voters of both parties away from the political centre. This becoming even more pronounced and the further apart each party becomes, the more important it is that they do not lose elections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voters for each party have become increasingly disenfranchised from those of the other party. In a Pew Research Survey conducted just before the election, 85% of US adults said that Biden and Trump supporters disagree not only on political policies and plans, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/11/06/2020-election-reveals-two-broad-voting-coalitions-fundamentally-at-odds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">but on basic facts</a>. This is hugely problematic. As the line between fact and faction blurs, for the core base of each party the cost of losing rises, leading to the occurrence of more extreme behaviour. Never has that been more clearly the case than the continued claims, believed by 84% of Republicans, that the election was stolen. The insurrection at the Capitol last week, and the insistence of Republican politicians such as Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley and 147 House Republicans to challenge the certification of the election results, shows the dangerous consequences for democracy that can occur in such a highly polarised and politically charged society. America views itself as the bedrock of democracy and the democratic process, and yet as a result of the continued polarisation of America and the disappearance of common ideological ground, threats to its democracy have become worryingly real.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether or not Biden will succeed it ‘Uniting’ America remains to be seen, but if one thing is certain it’s that Americans need to be able to at least agree on what is fact, and what is not.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>By Amelia Harbottle</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Comment your thoughts and rate this article below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/ameliaharbottle/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ad314d0c6020379ca10271e397923b35?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Amelia Harbottle\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/ameliaharbottle/\">Amelia Harbottle</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

As the global fatality rate rose, as did the alarm and despair of the population. But like water in a stream when faced with an obstacle, humanity will invariably find a way to work around it. The rooftop concerts, windowsill serenades and balcony concertos that materialised across the world filled the silence of empty roads and streets. Puncturing the monotony of isolation, there have been moments of purity; of unrivalled human social beauty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scientifically, it is abnormal for us as human beings to be forced to live in isolation. This has become painfully evident in the physiological and psychological effects that are being witnessed as a result of the lockdown. But this deprivation from normal social interaction catalyses our motivation to connect with others in atypical ways. Put simply, the social element of the brain needs to be stimulated, and if forced into isolation, it will find new ways to adapt and connect. Research has shown that when we listen to or produce music, our brain produces the hormone oxytocin – the same hormone that is released during face-to-face interactions. Music therefore is filling the void engendered by social isolation – we are subconsciously responding to the necessities of our body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josephine Shaw (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/josephineshawofficial/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@josephineshawofficial</a>) is a 17-year-old busker and musician from Esher in the UK, who performed for her neighbours during England’s first lockdown over the spring months. “Music has been so important during the pandemic because I feel like it’s something that truly connects us together,” Josephine says. “Despite the physical distance, being able to share in a musical experience from afar or online brings out such emotion in people, and particularly, inspires hope.” The potential that music has to offer companionship and a sense of solidarity has acted as a chink of light through the darkness of an inundation of distressing news headlines, proffering that despite the desperation generated by the pandemic, hope and optimism will persevere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps most poignant of all Josephine’s performances was her interpretation of Dame Vera Lynn’s ‘We’ll Meet Again’ on V-E day, a song that’s sentiment perfectly encapsulates the hope of the British public past and present. Josephine stands in her driveway, her busking equipment set rather haphazardly on a tattered chair to her side. The song ends to the rapturous applause of her fellow neighbours who stand listening from their driveways in a street adorned with fluttering Union Jacks. “It was incredible to see that when I started singing, many neighbours had arrived to listen, and that they really enjoyed it” she says. “I’ve also formed a much closer relationship with my lovely neighbours since.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fabio Marziali (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fmarzialisax/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@fmarzialisax</a>) has been playing the saxophone from the window of his apartment block in Rome, Italy since March 2020. His daughter often accompanies him, lovingly twirling around their balcony or bouncing on the sofa to the rich melodies of her father’s saxophone. Fabio played songs for his neighbours throughout Rome’s 72-day lockdown, catering for the entire audience of his neighbouring apartment blocks with a myriad of genres, performing beloved anthems such as ‘Over the Rainbow’ (17<sup>th</sup> day), ‘Imagine’ (19<sup>th</sup> day), ‘Amazing Grace’ (22<sup>nd</sup> day), and ‘La Vie En Rose’ (32<sup>nd</sup> day). Fabio even played a rendition of Baby Shark from his apartment window, allowing his daughter and her friend to dance together from their respective rooftops, a moment of ingenuity and blissful normalcy despite the anomalous situation. “It felt amazing of course and it gave my family and I a moment during the day to vent the stress and the fears out,” he explains; “people reacted in a much warmer way than I expected.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Fabio also rather soberingly reminded me that despite the fact that music has brought dynamism to a period of stasis, many musicians have lost their jobs, and many have “stopped music all together.” “Music was both a great source of pleasure entertainment and inspiration for people during lockdown, but I think as a community it was devastated.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Singer/songwriter Tori Sparks (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/torisparksmusic/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@torisparksmusic</a>) has been performing her galvanising blend of blues, flamenco and rock sung in both English and Spanish from her apartment rooftop in Barcelona, Spain. The floor lamp from her living room stands beside her, projecting a spotlight under which Tori performs, the pink and blue hues of the Spanish sunset illuminating her silhouette. When I asked Tori why she believed music had flourished despite the constraints of the coronavirus, she responded, “though we need to eat and pay bills just like anyone else, musicians are motivated by something that goes way beyond simply earning a living. Music is a vocation, it’s something you feel compelled to do. It’s who you are, whether you’re getting paid or not. So of course musicians will continue to make music, even when their concerts are all cancelled. And in times of crisis, writing a song or singing to your neighbours is a way to make something beautiful and positive come out of the darkness.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tori sang from her rooftop every Saturday at 8pm for eleven weeks during Spain’s lockdown. “I think it made a really positive impact on my neighbourhood, which was the idea. People felt like they were a part of something every Saturday evening, that they weren’t alone.” The power of music, or more specifically of unexpected and innovative endeavours towards fellowship in order to strengthen a community have been staggering in recent months, unifying neighbourhoods across the globe. “The neighbours were great. They were incredibly positive and even promised to defend me if the police came! (The police did come once, but it wasn’t a big deal). I tried to learn one song a week that was a request from one of them, and I think they appreciated the effort.” With regards to the online community, it was the same kind of super-positive reaction, but via email and message — after each show I usually spent until around 2 am answering everyone’s messages and comments, and I still get people writing to say thank you for doing them, all these months later.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think perhaps what has made these outpourings of music all the more enchanting, is the prevalence of artificially fabricated connections in our day-to-day lives. Most of our communication, even before the pandemic seemed to be accompanied by the luminescent blue glow of a phone screen; be it online dating, mindlessly browsing social media, texting, or emailing. But this disconnection, albeit still physically enforced by imposed restrictions, seems to have been splintered by these pockets of melodic salvation. Music has acted as an antidote to the fear, isolation, and loneliness that the pandemic has brutally elicited. To hope for a cultural reset in terms of forging connections more organically may be too much to hope for, but these musical interventions have undoubtedly demonstrated that in times of desperation and uncertainty humanity will set aside their phones in favour of a more primal form of social camaraderie.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/maisieringer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Maisie Ringer </a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Comment your thoughts and rate this article below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/maisieringer/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/aecdc0cd9db876b8c18603e7a744aa80?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Maisie Ringer\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/maisieringer/\">Maisie Ringer</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

The days of sports enterprises relying solely on individuals with deep pockets, such as Russian oligarchs and business moguls (read James Montagu’s <em>The Billionaires Club</em>) may be behind us, but cash-strapped clubs and leagues are desperate to find new ways to fill COVID shaped holes in their balance sheets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There has been an exponential growth in <a href=\"https://www.bdo.co.uk/en-gb/insights/industries/leisure-and-hospitality/private-equity-in-sport-it-will-only-get-bigger\">private equity in sport</a> in the last few years, shown recently with <a href=\"https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/six-nations-cvc-deal-investment-stake-bernard-laporte-rugby-union#:~:text=Rugby%20union's%20Six%20Nations%20is,cent%20stake%20in%20the%20competition.\">CVC Partners&#8217; acquisition </a>of a stake in the Six Nations. Private equity should be classified as capital investment made into companies that are not publicly listed (Investopedia) and &#8220;<em>the appetite and incentives of most private equity investors are firmly focused on achieving capital gains</em>” (ICAEW). Especially for rugby, where the financial backing is often from rich owners, Steve Lansdowne and Bruce Craig in <a href=\"https://www.therugbypaper.co.uk/all/domestic-club-rugby-union/33205/who-is-the-premiership-richest-club-owner/#:~:text=BRISTOL%20BEARS%20owner%20Steve%20Lansdown,country%20with%20%C2%A31.72bn.\">the Premiership</a>, for example, the emergence of private equity offers a very different opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even before 2020, when sport felt disproportional pressure due to the majority of its income streams reliant on sport events going ahead (TV rights and matchday hospitality), there had been a global shift to the welcoming arms of institutional investors. The interest of private equities in sport first hit the headlines with CVC Partners investing US$2 billion in 2006, which returned an equity value of US$4.4 billion in 2016; returns that left them desperate for more and their <a href=\"https://www.rugbypass.com/news/rugby-union-just-a-tiny-part-of-15-billion-play/\">VII Fund</a> has since gone searching for. The <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/12/06/covid-19-heightens-private-equity-investors-interest-in-sport\">Economist</a>’s article identified four key attractions of sport for investors: (i) it is one of the few spectacles that fans consistently watch live, (ii) sport offers the chance to build synergies with alternate revenue streams (betting, esports, and fantasy leagues), (iii) ownership offers the opportunity of fame and notoriety and, (iv) sport is run inefficiently, so offers private equity their ideal opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A practical example is <a href=\"https://www.premiershiprugby.com/2018/12/20/premiership-rugby-confirm-new-partnership-with-cvc-capital-partners/#:~:text=The%20investment%20by%20CVC%20Capital,invest%20in%20a%20minority%20shareholding.\">CVC Partners&#8217; investment</a> into Premiership Rugby of £200m for a 27% stake in the league, with each of the 13 clubs reportedly receiving <a href=\"https://www.rugbypass.com/news/premiership-club-collectively-lost-millions-in-the-last-financial-year-reports/\">£13.5m</a> back at the end of the 2018/19 season, which surely provided all clubs with the capacity to survive 2020. These financial benefits are clear, but at what price? An article in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/sep/10/cvc-ownership-f1-warning-premiership-rugby-union\">The Guardian</a> tells of CVC Partner’s “<em>pursuit of profit at every possible level</em>” in a scathing rebuke of CVCs involvement with Formula 1. There is a stark contrast between the ruthless corporate world associated with private equity and the fans who see sport as an essential and intensely emotional aspect of their lives; the threat of private equity is the removal of this enigmatic essence of sport. This is despite CVC’s assurances that they will “<em>have no involvement with sporting and regulatory decisions</em>” (<a href=\"https://www.rugbyworld.com/in-the-mag/what-are-cvcs-plans-for-rugby-111566\">CVC representative in Rugby World</a>), which does little to ease fans’ fears.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, private equity involvement offers far more than a boost to the balance sheet for sport, with an opportunity to increase efficiency with experienced business leaders. Since CVC Partners acquired their stake in Premiership Rugby Zoe Clapp and Mark Brittain have joined as <a href=\"https://www.premiershiprugby.com/news/premiership-rugby-strengthens-executive-leadership-team\">CMO and CCO respectively</a>, both of whom have a wealth of experience in their respective fields that will hopefully improve the end product delivered to the fans. This contrasts with the ex-professionals who regularly fill senior positions at sports enterprises based on their sporting experience, as opposed to their commercial aptitude. Although sport may often be portrayed as an idealistic phenomenon fuelled by passion, the pandemic has reminded those involved with sport that many people’s livelihoods hinge on their commercial success, which has accelerated the need for solid corporate finance more than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Private equity, in general, allows the realisation of capital that, in turn, can be reinvested into the business. Sport is the same in this regard, with vast opportunities to grow into Over The Top <a href=\"https://www.foley.com/en/insights/publications/2020/11/private-equity-institutional-investment-sports#:~:text=The%20rapid%20rise%20of%20sports,of%20%24300%20billion%20by%202019\">streaming services</a> providing a better product for the consumer, and potentially bridging the divide with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e7cd1092-aec6-484f-a2f7-114b52c9ff9c\">Esports</a>. This last opportunity is rapidly rising, with <a href=\"https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/newzoo-esports-sponsorship-alone-will-generate-revenues-of-more-than-600-million-this-year/#:~:text=The%20esports%20audience%20will%20grow,to%20295.4%20million%20in%202023.\">Newzoo</a> reporting “<em>esports audience growing to 495m people globally in 2020.</em>” These growth markets are viable in all manner of sports, but crucially need capital investment to succeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Linking back to Premiership Rugby, although there are few requirements on clubs reinvesting, it is hoped academy pathways will be strengthened in order to raise the quality of talent in the future and to improve the product for fans. However, critics view the same scenario as football playing out where cash injections lead to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/10/premierships-cash-injection-could-hit-fans-players-and-lower-tier-clubs\">wages spiralling</a> out of control. Specifically in the case of rugby, the gap between the Premiership and the Championship will only grow wider (added to this is the <a href=\"https://www.englandrugby.com/news/article/update-on-rfu-funding-of-greene-king-ipa-championship\">decrease in RFU funding</a> to the Championship) and may hamper the sport as a whole. It is important to note these issues are specific to rugby and, due to the breadth in characteristics of sport, it is hard to draw direct comparisons as CVC’s legacy in Formula 1 has seen <a href=\"https://www.theceomagazine.com/lifestyle/automotive/formula-e-motorsport/\">Formula E becoming the fastest growing form of motorsport</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only time will tell of the long-term consequences of institutional investors continued exposure to sport. But for now, there is no denying that the fans all over the world are glad that sport has so far survived the global pandemic. And more transparent and more efficient sporting entities can only be a positive for its growth, especially when this provides further enjoyment for the fans who make sport what it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>By Fergus Hamilton</p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/fergushamilton/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a3bbf2ed3398873bfad9f582cdc14246?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Fergus Hamilton\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/fergushamilton/\">Fergus Hamilton</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">As I sit at my desk searching for the words to describe the events of yesterday and convey my emotions towards them, I find myself truly dumbfounded.&nbsp; Firstly, let’s be clear, the events of last night were a failed Coup d’état. Watching live as the Capitol building was enveloped in tear gas, attempting to disperse the thousands of Pro-Trump supporters swarming the steps of the heart of US Government is one of the many images that is characteristic of the disaster that has been Trump’s presidency. I call it a coup because it categorically set out to disrupt and delegitimise the incoming administration led by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. A coup can simply be described as “a violent and illegal seizure of power from a government.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst the right-wing trump supporters attempted this by storming the grounds of the Capitol, it is more than important to acknowledge the attempts by those elected officials within Government that have consistently spued false claims of election fraud and disrupted the transition of power over to President-elect Joe Biden. These are two sides to the same coin; without the instigation by leaders of the Republican Party and President Trump, we would not have seen the chaos that ensued across Capitol Hill. Whilst many are disengaged and dismissive of the consistent, hyperbolic rhetoric churned out by President Trump, yesterday’s events make it desperately clear that many of his supporters are unwavering in their support and act on his command. He lit the fuse to a bomb of his own design that has now left American democracy in shatters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been mused in the past that President Tump’s Government is fascist in nature and, whilst I have believed this for the most part of his tenure in office, yesterday’s events leave me with no doubt. As I look back throughout history to begin to make sense of such an event, I’m astonished at the similarities between yesterday’s coup and the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923 (just switch out a few key names, dates and phrases in this <a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/germany/beer-hall-putsch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">History.com</a> article and you’ll see my point).</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/capitol-1.jpg?resize=640%2C360&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2280\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/capitol-1.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/capitol-1.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday was a blatant display of white privilege that continues to rot the core of American society. As protesters wondered the hallways of the Capitol, sitting at the dais of the senate chamber, or putting their feet up at Nancy Pelosi’s desk, one begins to wonder if these protests were black what sort of scenes we would be watching. One only has to look back at the shocking scenes from this summer to begin to get an idea. Instead, protesters brandishing Confederate flags, MAGA hats and neo-Nazi t-shirts, were effectively let in by Police in what has got to be the largest US security breach since 9/11 – though, I doubt the US response will be as damning to the leaders of this terrorist incident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, you cannot ignore the glaring sense of irony surrounding the whole incident. Like much of Mr. Trump’s presidency, yesterday’s events are doused in hypocrisy. From the reaction by law enforcement towards the protesters; the catalogue of tweets by Trump that are laughably applicable to the actions of the protestors; to the protesters themselves who undoubtedly chanted “Blue Lives Matter” months ago now seen chasing down those same blue lives they so vehemently protected just months ago. Once again we are shown that blue lives matter is easily translated to black lives don’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst I wish I could say this will be the peak for America, and that the President-elect will unite the deeply divided country and begin to rebuild what’s left of a flailing state and government, I’m highly doubtful. Unity cannot come without some form of recognition of deeply rooted, institutional problems that plague American society. Biden represents one half of America that wishes to re-establish the ‘true America’, whilst the other half scream “make America great again.” This false binary only serves to leave an unaccounted and somewhat insidious hole in the middle of the US politics, a hole so gaping it is beginning to eat American democracy alive. Yesterday, we saw it take a large bite.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/alexstorey/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alex Storey </a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Comment your thoughts and rate this article below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/alexstorey/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2d184c164e66d3f4ac57080a2e0f01fa?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Alex Storey\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/alexstorey/\">Alex Storey</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

As we avidly stride into 2021, surely only the fainthearted would take on the steep task of trying to summarise the year into just one word. Yet the team of lexicographers at Oxford English Dictionary were faced with the task of just that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conflicting with their standing traditions, Oxford English Dictionary (OED) has struggled to narrow down their findings to a singular term for their annual Word of the Year. In precedented times, the word would stand as a tribute to the English language, and as a reflection and suitable summary of the most popular, most used, most overused or first coined words of the previous 365 days. Usually taking the form of the latest zeitgeist creation, OED has formerly crowned words like “<em>selfie</em>”, “<em>fake news</em>”, “<em>climate change</em>”. But in true 2020 fashion, this year’s campaign is a bit different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lexicographers at OED have described 2020 as “a year that could not be accommodated in one single word” and have therefore designated a selection of words instead. Their report is said to cover the themes of the English language that were at the forefront of our minds this year; from Covid-19 and its expansive associated jargon, to social activism, political, economic, environmental and technological related vocabulary. So, without further ado, here are some of the words that OED believed to have defined 2020:</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Covid-19, WFH, lockdown, circuit breaker, support-bubbles, keyworkers, Black Lives Matter, and furlough</em>. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With countless seismic events occurring this year, lifestyles drastically changing across the globe, and public conversation being dominated by the pandemic, it is hardly surprising that this literary revolution has occurred.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-55016543\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BBC recorded</a>, the use of the word ‘<em>pandemic’</em> has increased by 57,000%, ‘<em>following the science</em>’ by 1,000% and ‘<em>unmute</em>’ by 500%. Swiftly and gladly moving away from any Covid-related terminology, at the start of the year, the use of the words ‘<em>impeachment</em>’ and ‘<em>acquittal</em>’ increased by 3,000%. During the summer, ‘<em>Black Lives Matter</em>’ and ‘<em>BLM</em>’ usage surged significantly. And to end the year in true British fashion, the use of ‘<em>Brexit’</em> has fallen by 80%. As we have all adapted to the ‘new normal’, which I might add is a phrase that will always haunt me, some entertaining neologisms have appeared in the English language this year. Despite some words reminding us of the cruel actualities of 2020, other literary inventions did manage to bring a bit of cheer: ‘<em>Quarantinis’</em> (a cocktail one drinks whilst in quarantine), ‘<em>Coronacoaster’</em> (the emotional experience of life during the pandemic) and ‘<em>Covidiot’</em> (a slang insult for someone who disregards the virus health and safety guidelines).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The overwhelming irony is that 2020 has left so many of us speechless, yet it is impossible to summarise the year into just one word. Radical, substantial, heart-breaking, even difficult, none seem to do 2020 justice. So, perhaps we shouldn’t try to limit it solely to one word, but instead learn from its evident limitations on the English language and continue with what we’ve been practicing all year: adapting and overcoming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When opening up this question to others, most responses were, as you can probably guess, colourful (to say the least). Yet, the recurring answer was always ‘<em>unprecedented’</em>. In spite of any criticism that OED may have received for changing their tradition to accommodate to 2020 – this is just one of many sacrifices that have been made this year across the world. So, here’s hoping to just the one word to describe 2021. Maybe ‘<em>precedented’</em>, ‘<em>normality’</em>, or ‘<em>interaction’</em>. However, my bet’s on ‘<em>better’</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/sophiahill/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sophia Hill </a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Comment your thoughts and rate this article below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/sophiahill/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/773e30cf9e40406f81ebd8cb25ada8cc?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Sophia Hill\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/sophiahill/\">Sophia Hill</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The coronavirus pandemic has brought about a new way of life for the British people. Many have lost their jobs, with the most recent <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55313752\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">unemployment rate</a> soaring to 4.9% on the lead up to October which has left a total of 1.7 million people out of work. Many of us are left isolated in our homes: some experiencing redundancy and fear for the future, others isolated due to ill-health or their old age separating them from their loved ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wasn’t it all just so much simpler before the pandemic? Compare the ease of opportunity to meet people, to work, to travel and to see our friends and family against the complexity and uncertainty of life as we know it now. These normalities seem like a distant memory, and it is difficult to recall life without the claustrophobia of mask-wearing, repetitive hand sanitising and awkward elbow touches for greetings. If our society wasn’t already teetering on the edge of a digital revolution then we can safely say that the pandemic has got the ball rolling. Remote working, home-schooling, university lectures and seminars online, group zoom calls, virtual gym classes, FaceTime dates. These new and impersonal ways of life threaten to become the permanent norm as we all wait anxiously to see what the future holds. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet I believe that it is not all doom and gloom. If we can look towards any positives that have evolved during this exceptional time, I believe one of those is the more frank and open conversations about sex which have been forced to take place. What the pandemic has brought to light is our society’s collective desire for physical intimacy: we are edging away from seeing casual sex as something indecent or excessive. Rather, sex is increasingly being considered as an absolutely essential factor to maintaining one’s mental well-being. However we British still seem to see the subject as unworthy of serious discussion; taboo even. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But not so for the Dutch! The Netherlands’ open-minded approach to intimacy during the pandemic seemed to lead the way on this progressive train of thought. Back in March, Dutch officials advised single people to find a regular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/dutch-official-advice-to-single-people-find-a-sex-buddy-for-lockdown-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>seksbuddy</em></a>: a likeminded individual you can link up with as long as you are both free of illness. This advice was issued after wide-spread frustration expressed by Dutch singletons. Journalist Linda Duits had openly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/dutch-official-advice-to-single-people-find-a-sex-buddy-for-lockdown-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">criticised</a> the RIVM’s (Dutch Health Ministry) announcements that all individuals should keep a 1.5 metre distance in home visits and argued that ‘proximity and physical contact are not a luxury, they are basic needs’. With demand increasing from the public, the RIVM conceded and acknowledged that effectively outlawing ‘sex for singletons’ was an unrealistic demand. Thus the <em>seksbuddy</em> initiative came in. Can we really imagine the British government following in the Netherlands’ footsteps, even if it proved to boost people’s well-being at this exceptional time?</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly not: of course the situation for the British public is somewhat different. For many months now the majority of England has been forced to swallow what is now being widely labelled as the government’s <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/casual-sex-illegal-people-who-22855315\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">‘casual sex’</a> ban. The ban officially started back in <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/coronavirus-covid-19-what-has-changed-22-september\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">late-September</a>, when the government announced further national measures to address rising covid cases. One such measure was that those who lived together, those in a legally permitted support bubble or those in an ‘<a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-social-distancing-rules-relaxed-for-couples-in-established-relationships-12079505\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">established relationship</a>’ did not have to socially distance. Wide-spread hormonal confusion amongst the British public followed the announcement. What, we ask ourselves, is an established relationship? Health Secretary Matt Hancock was directly asked this question by<a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/health/established-relationship-meaning-what-covid-matt-hancock-who-can-have-sex-657507\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Kay Burley on Sky News</a>. She asked: ‘what does [established relationships] mean to you? I mean I know what it means for you and Mrs Hancock but…’ Hancock responded with a bashful grin ‘that is exactly how I was going to answer. I know<em> I’m</em> in an established relationship.’ As much we are all chuffed to hear that the Health Secretary is maintaining a hearty sex life during the pandemic this sadly can’t be said for a large majority of the British population.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/handock1.jpg?resize=640%2C480&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2256\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/handock1.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/handock1.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/handock1.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/handock1.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>With even tougher restrictions now having been enforced and with London and much of the South East in tier 4, we can firmly say that any sort of intimacy this Christmas period is off the cards for much of the country. And in terms of any sort of festive romance, mixing indoors in tiers 2, 3 or 4 with anyone outside of your household is still forbidden. <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/12/01/sex-ban-will-continue-in-tier-two-and-three-for-couples-living-apart-13680535/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">When being asked </a>by a member of the public in tier 2 whether she and her boyfriend (who are in an ‘established relationship’ but don’t live together) could meet up indoors, Hancock danced around the direct question but repeated the rules of no mixing outside of your household. This confirmation of no sex indoors for couples living apart&nbsp; &#8211; without of course actually stating the words ‘no sex indoors’ (heaven forbid such things coming live from Downing Street) only threw fuel on the fire, and many were left sexually frustrated and despondent in its wake.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we all love to grasp at straws, and the rules clearly state no mixing indoors but the outdoors remains more of a grey area. So yes, in a typically British way, whatever the weather many folk have taken to the great outdoors for their casual hook ups or love making. Immediately, romantic and steamy scenes from films come rushing to mind, where a couple find a long-abandoned house or are seen rolling around in a field, somehow undisturbed by wasps, midges or dog walkers. Yet, in reality, such an endeavour proves to be much more anxiety-provoking and dangerous. But have no fear &#8211; The Sunday Times has got your back. Their <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/banned-sex-indoors-so-heres-your-guide-to-getting-frisky-al-fresco-n3zdctg8p?wgu=270525_54264_16075943748166_b6f6b02d7d&amp;wgexpiry=1615370374&amp;utm_source=planit&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=22278\" target=\"_blank\">substantial guide</a> on how to get ‘frisky al fresco’ includes much helpful advice on how to have hassle-free sex outdoors. Such advice includes recommending some safer sex positions to minimise the chance of catching and spreading the virus. The missionary position is a firm no I’m afraid. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore whether people like it or not, national conversation around sex has increased during the pandemic. Whether the discussion covers the legality of the tryst, how to <a href=\"https://www.tht.org.uk/news/how-have-sex-while-managing-risk-covid-19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">minimise the chance of infection</a> or just seeing the Health Secretary squirm whilst answering sex-related questions, sex has been, perhaps surprisingly, an ever-present topic during this crisis. This is absolutely a move in the right direction. Sexual silence is so <em>not </em>this year and in fact we should be shouting about sex and intimacy in such an isolating time. Open conversations are what we need as a society, and in turn we can phase out archaic views that sexual desire is something to be embarrassed about or avoided in conversation. Merry Christmas and don’t forget that all good things come to those who wait: we will all be reunited again soon and free to have sex once more!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/larakeville/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lara Keville</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Comment your thoughts and rate this article below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/larakeville/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76bbebf22b4349a8a5bf356f09eb45b5?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Lara Keville\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/larakeville/\">Lara Keville</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Again and again and again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was my daily routine for three months, the very same ritual that thousands of other graduates have religiously maintained since leaving university this summer. Inboxes littered with job alerts from Milkround, Totaljobs and Indeed. In a digital world where my social media knows that I am dreaming of a ski holiday and yearning for new pair of shoes, I had high hopes for the A.I. systems used by these recruitment sites. Alas, they seemed intent on sending me ‘targeted’ adverts for roles requiring 5+ years of experience and starting salaries of £80,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Agitated by this mass bombardment of irrelevant information and hours of trawling the interminable depths of such job sites, finally you will strike gold. ‘Looking for a self-starter, graduate with 2:1 or above, start date immediately.’ How many have applied? 400 applicants; could be worse. Cover letter written, CV attached, and email sent. A moment of excited imagination overtakes; sitting in that ‘young, fun office’, enjoying ‘team meals on a Friday’ and all whilst being paid a ‘competitive salary’ that will certainly get you that pair of trainers and maybe even stretch to the ski holiday too. But, all of a sudden, you are dragged back to reality by the recognition that you won’t actually be in an office, but instead working in your dingy kitchen and not eating out with anyone on a Friday due to the current purgatorial state of lockdown.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, even these sad realisations prove to be merely inconsequential mirages when weeks later the ping of your inbox rings clear and the inevitable bombshell of that automated rejection email surfaces on your screen. ‘Unfortunately, we will not be progressing your application.’ All you may want to ask now is ‘why not?’ But, expect no feedback, no help – nothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, this process genuinely became comical. I could no longer take seriously the eternal state of rejection I was in. I was convinced that I was experiencing some sort of labour market-induced insanity. Reaching breaking point, I slammed my laptop shut and found the first part-time job I came across. Packaging food deliveries in a dimly lit warehouse sounded comparatively pleasurable to the torture of the last couple of months. I took the job in an instant. Then everything snowballed. Within a month I was no longer packing dear old Betty’s weekly groceries but found myself in a silk draped poolroom interviewing an elderly gentleman about his remarkable life. I still can’t quite comprehend the turn around. How I found myself ghostwriting a biography remains baffling, but the point is this; if I had not broken the cycle that I was trapped in, I would not be where I am now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To those of you out there in the position I was in, barely able to find the emotional energy to sustain another rejection, just stop. In the toughest labour market for 75 years, with graduate job openings shrunk by 77% since the start of the year and more than a quarter of all UK business reducing the number of graduates they recruit, it is time for you to change things up. The old model no longer works so please stop trying to make it. Sign up to TaskRabbit; build an Ikea bed, help someone move house, walk an old lady’s dog. You will be shocked at the wealth of opportunities that are born from these situations and at the very least your eyes won’t burn and your ego won’t hurt from spending your days scrolling LinkedIn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ‘Lost Generation’ of the 1920s that has always been held in nostalgic esteem is not so different to the Class of 2020. A world reeling with the despair of war and disease is far too relatable right now. As poor as they were, Hemingway and Fitzgerald did not let themselves to be crushed under the pressure of the past but, instead, used it as inspiration. Obviously I am not asking you to drop everything, take up the bottle and start writing some of the best literature ever produced. I am, however, imploring that you take the current situation we are in and, like these creatives, become more innovative. If you are scared of such a prospect, always remember this: what is there to lose? Given the current job market for graduates, I would argue, absolutely nothing!</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/henrycrane/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Henry Crane </a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Comment your thoughts and rate this article below</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/henrycrane/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3bce09a868c156c5e0de26e095e481d5?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Henry Crane\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/henrycrane/\">Henry Crane</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">2020 has been a record-breaking year for fundraising in the UK. <em>Captain Tom’s 100th Birthday Walk</em> raised nearly £33 million, a new Guinness World record, beating the previous record by over £10 million. On top of that, despite the economic hardship being felt nationwide, the <em>NHS Together </em>charity received over £130 million in donations this year. It is wonderful that being charitable remains an important part of our national identity even during a global pandemic, and such generosity has never been more needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a time where people are having to be more budget-conscious, many households have definitely managed to save on their cinema bills.  The price, coupled with the perceived risk of infection, was enough to put people off paying for a trip to the silver screen and as such, 2020 has been brutal for the filmmaking industry. Most severely felt by the independent sector &#8211; whose sets, cinemas and workforce were frozen overnight &#8211; but also noticed by traditional juggernauts like Disney and Universal. Though the storm is being weathered far better by the likes of Netflix and other early adopters of the streaming model, remarkably, for a brief period, even the ever-churning treadmill of Hollywood was brought to a halt. In early March this year it was predicted that the global <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office\">box office</a> could lose $5 billion as a result of the pandemic. I am not mourning Hollywood’s loss in profits (I actually think there’s a collective sense of schadenfreude when a juggernaut gets kicked in the balls), but it has made me consider the immense wealth present in the film industry, and how it could be better used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are now wondering what the link between charitable fundraising and filmmaking is, then good, because I am too. More specifically, I am wondering why the two aren’t linked more closely. Why do filmmakers, with such a platform, such attention and such influence in the public space, choose not to use fundraising more clearly in their film’s marketing and presentation? Production companies are extremely effective at <em>raising funds </em>to invest into their films, and a cinema audience is fertile ground for a donation appeal, especially if it appears after a movie that’s made them really <em>feel </em>something about a certain cause. What if, for example, at the end of the environmental docu-drama <em>Dark Waters </em>(dir. Tom Haynes, starring Mark Ruffalo), the first credit said something like “Please donate to <a href=\"https://act.fidra.org.uk/foreverchemicals\">Fidra to stop organisations dumping toxic plastics (PFAS</a>)”? To me, that sounds like an effective fundraising tactic. It sounds like a way to facilitate your audience in supporting a cause that your film (hopefully) just made them care about. At the end of <em>Dark Waters, </em>if Mark Ruffalo tells me to do something: I’m doing it. At the end of your film you’ve just engaged a crowd and presented your argument; why would you not try to harness that for concrete social impact?</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I find the idea of using film as an agent for community action and social change both alluring and daunting. Whether you like it or not, depending on what you’re advocating for or against, once you decide to stamp a “call to action” on your film, you <em>are</em> acting politically, and that decision carries an increased responsibility. Of course even the most anodyne films sit <em>somewhere </em>on the political spectrum, but I’m talking about films including a more obvious demand:  “Donate”, “Sign”, “Protest”, “Vote”.  This kind of direct appeal is common within the theatre world, near the exit of shows from fringe to West End, where collection tins eagerly await departing audiences. Recently there have been more examples of this approach in film, especially in the context of the 2020 US Presidential election. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aZPJBjutY0\">Tenacious D’s Halloween cover of <em>the Rocky Horror Picture Show’s </em>“Time Warp”</a> featured a repeated “vote” message (not-so-incidentally coloured a royal Democrat blue), and at the end of Sacha Baron Cohen’s <em>Borat’s Subsequent Moviefilm </em>the first credit read: “NOW VOTE. OR YOU WILL BE EXECUTE.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Explicitly politicising your film in this way does, however, carry the risk of isolating audience demographics and hurting your box office, and that’s a risk that many production companies are not willing to take. Several high-profile actors resist even the idea of becoming “political”. In 2016, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/mark-wahlberg-celebrities-should-not-talk-about-politics-us-election-a7449976.html\">Mark Wahlberg said celebrities should not talk about politics </a>and that “A lot of celebrities shouldn’t [give their political opinions]”. Wahlberg’s comments were echoed in November 2020 when actor <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/movies/kurt-russell-goldie-hawn-christmas.html\">Kurt Russell said Hollywood and Politics don’t mix</a>, and actors should “step away from saying anything”. Clearly Mark Wahlberg and Kurt Russell aren’t leading Hollywood’s progressive charge, but they are both nonetheless respected and influential. Their comments, however, fail to acknowledge the privilege inherent in choosing the position to “step away from saying anything”.  Non-participation is not an option for those who <em>need</em> change, and high-profile actors are indisputably effective at mobilising the public, whether that’s to sell tickets, buy products or, as John Boyega powerfully displayed this year, march for Black Lives Matter. As such, if you’re a Hollywood actor too afraid to engage with complex issues faced by real people, educate yourself and then <em>start</em> participating. You have a platform, influence and affluence &#8211; don’t just use them to sell your films.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started with the question, “why don’t filmmakers use their films to fundraise for charitable causes?”, and the answer could be extremely dull. There may be some perfectly reasonable law that prohibits this approach to fundraising, as it resembles a kind of ethically dubious and manipulative advertising tactic (and maybe that’s fair enough!), but let’s pretend the only reason that this method of fundraising isn’t happening is simply because one too many powerful actors, directors and producers aren’t convinced that it’s important enough &#8211; that it’s <em>worth the risk</em> &#8211; but surely that tide is changing? Surely the current need for charity is too great, and (given the price of tickets, and therefore relative wealth of cinema goers) those being asked to donate in this context do have the means to do so. Imagine a world where this spirit of fundraising was integrated more deeply into Hollywood’s filmmaking culture: The highest paid talent could commit a fraction of their immense earnings towards a cause relevant to the film; production companies would donate a percentage of their profits to relevant fundraising campaigns, and you knew that £2 of your ticket would go towards charities, not salaries. That’s a world in which I’d like to live, work and watch films.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a new filmmaker, I wanted to stop “imagining”  this approach to fundraising and start testing the concept in my own work. My most recent project &#8211; <em>I Wanna Do Christmas With You (Again):</em>  a magical Christmas comedy music video about Santa’s dark origin story &#8211; ends with an appeal to donate to Age UK, and I have been amazed with the response so far. It’s important to note that I didn’t set out to fundraise with the music video from day one so, unlike the plan above, the charity’s cause and the video’s content aren’t really related, but I couldn’t resist the opportunity to try, especially given I work with vulnerable elderly people every day. In my 9 to 5, I work as an Advocate for people who lack mental capacity. The majority of the people I work with have dementia and are staying in care homes with no friends or family willing or able to support them. Every day I see first-hand the importance of company, affection and representation for elderly people and marginalised groups, particularly this year when the usual support networks have been so devastatingly compromised. Our video is a bit of silly Christmas fun, but we want all those that enjoyed it to give to Age UK, who work to support the elderly all year round.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outlined above are reasons for why I believe fundraising and filmmaking can be such an effective combination, I now turn to you to help me prove this theory right. At the time of writing, we have raised over £700 and I want YOU to donate too. I want you to donate because of the great things Age UK can do with your money. I want you to donate because of the direct impact it has on the people I work with, and I want you to donate because IT’S CHRISTMAS, and giving to those in need is what it’s all about. Additionally, if I do ever have a career in film, I’d like my Christmas music video to be the first of many examples where I harness the incredible power of film to generate genuine, positive social impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Donate here: </strong><a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/christmaswithyou\">https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/christmaswithyou</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"I Wanna Do Christmas With You (Again) - Official Music Video\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VcTGPVjRBt4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Donate here: </strong><a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/christmaswithyou\">https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/christmaswithyou</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Alex Urquhart</em></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/admin/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6732f8a705abdd596d0c587bb01459b7?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Herd Community\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/admin/\">Herd Community</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Of course, it was. Why is it that some people understand you without you even opening your mouth whilst others seem to be on a completely different planet to you? This is what Thomas Erikson explains in his international bestseller, ‘surrounded by idiots.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Erikson explains that people’s behaviour can be characterised into 4 different colours: red, yellow, green and blue. People who are mainly green or green combined with one other colour are the most common and entirely red or red with one other colour are the least common. The majority of people (80%) have a combination of 2 colours that affect their behaviour. Around 5% have only 1 colour that dominates and the rest are dominated by 3 colours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Goal orientated extroverts</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reds are dominant and love to take charge. They are fast paced, make quick decisions and are not afraid of taking risks. This can make them seem controlling and impatient. They are strong-willed, ambitious, competitive and don’t easily give-up. They have an opinion on everything, and everyone needs to know it. They can come across as aggressive, argumentative, blunt and rash. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>People orientated extroverts</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yellows are enthusiastic and can light up any room with their wit, charm, energy and optimism. They never fail to provide others with entertainment and are the happy-go-lucky ones. They are creative, think outside of the box and are likely to follow feelings instead of reason and rationality. They can also come across as chaotic, egotistical and self-centred. They LOVE to talk and are good at it. They can convince you into believing the wildest things which can be inspiring. But they are terrible listeners and can be accused of living in their own world with their wild imagination. They focus on the future and have 10 things on the go at the same time so never finish tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>People orientated Introverts</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Greens are easy-going, considerate, tolerant and reliable. They genuinely care about others and so will always offer to help if you need it. They get on with things quietly, calmly and avoid any conflict at all costs to maintain the peace. They strive for stability so hate change. They can come across as lazy, gullible, indecisive, insecure and even two-faced; they won’t say it to your face but will happily vent and not hold back when talking about you with someone they trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Task orientated Introverts</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analytical blues love facts, problem-solving, structure and organisation. They carefully think through every decision and make rational/ logical decisions. A blue will never talk just for the sake of talking, but when they do say something, you can be certain its correct. They won’t do/say things to show off- blues doesn’t care about approval from others, if he knows he’s rights, that’s good enough for him. They can come across as dull, serious. They are very cautious so can be seen as indecisive. Blues are the realists- some may read this as pessimists and critical &#8211; as they will point out the risks and errors.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"483\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Surrounded.jpg?resize=640%2C483&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2230\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Surrounded.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Surrounded.jpg?resize=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Surrounded.jpg?resize=768%2C579&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you worked out which one, or two, you or others around you might be yet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no ‘good’ or ‘bad’ colours. The aim of the book is to make it easier for us to communicate and understand each other. Afterall, misunderstanding someone’s behaviour and intentions can be disastrous. The book also helps to make us more self-aware of our own behaviour. It’s simplistic and dangerous to automatically characterise someone who behaves differently to you as wrong, ignorant, weird or an idiot. Erikson states that instead, it is very useful to understand why the person reacts the way he does and his point of view. This is essential in the world of work and life in general. We need to appreciate and respect each colour’s strengths and weaknesses as each has immense value but also learn to adapt appropriately to each other to maintain cohesion and achieve our personal and shared goals. All the colours need to learn to compromise when working in a team. They need to meet each other in the middle or toes will be trampled on and feelings will be hurt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how do you communicate with each colour according to Erikson?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reds: Stick to the point. They’re not very patient. They want to complete a set task and they want to do it fast so speed up if you can. Everyone could use a red’s focus and determination. But reds also need to realise rushing everything is not always the best way. Sometimes details are important, and they need to be patient with people and careful with others’ feelings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yellows: Yellows require patience. They don’t think in a straight line. Allow them their space but if they start to wander, bring them back on track. They react badly if you try to control them though. Yellows need positivity around them- they struggle around negativity. Everyone could use a yellow’s optimism and creativity. Yellows could do with listening more to others instead of doing all the talking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Greens: Be friendly and listen when they speak. Give them time and encouragement. You won’t get a straight-forward answer with them- maybe ask them again when you’re alone. They hate conflict or aggression so acting pushy will make them close themselves off to you. Everyone could use a Green’s kindness and support. A green could do with believing in themselves and their opinions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blues: They like their personal space- physically and psychologically and will open up to you in their own time. Blues are perfectionists so give them time but also a little nudge every now and again because to them- nothing is ever perfect. Make sure you know your facts before making claims because they will question it. If you make errors, they will judge you. Everyone could use a Blue’s emphasis on rationality, quality and organisation. Blues could do with understanding that not every plan/thing has to be perfect.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/joynath/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">By Joy Nath </a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Comment your thoughts and rate this article below!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/joynath/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/938baa8fd450e32351adcc1b2a07ea0d?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Joy Nath\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/joynath/\">Joy Nath</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Since Boris Johnson was the leading protagonist for the Brexit vote and got into power on the back of the slogan ‘Get Brexit Done’, it is now imperative that this government secures trade deals with non-EU countries. The most important of which is, of course, the United States, with whom we have this so-called ‘special relationship’ which often feels more like the relationship between a dog and its owner rather than one on equal footing. Some large points of contention for this deal are healthcare, food and climate policy, all of which, if we were to adhere to American standards, would be a regression from EU laws and regulations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article I want to focus specifically on the effects an American trade deal could have on the food on our plate. The US are supposedly looking to ‘liberate’ US-UK trade as a continuation of their neoliberal agenda that bemoans any type of regulation and puts the responsibility of health and safety into the hands of the market. They would like to see the replacement of public, non-profit accreditation bodies on food standards with private American firms who, let’s be honest, you would not want in charge of regulating the temperature of your shower let alone the food you ingest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what an acceptance of American food standards in the UK would look like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Chlorinated chickens </strong>&#8211; Chickens are kept in filth that is so insanitary during their lives that they are soaked in chlorine or other chemicals after being butchered in order to kill any bacteria.</li><li><strong>Antibiotic and hormone pumped meat</strong> &#8211; Not only does this mean a horrendous quality of meat and a nauseating concoction of pharmaceuticals for humans to ingest but it also threatens the future effectiveness of antibiotics as a vital medicine. This practice has been banned by the EU since 1989.</li><li><strong>GM-processed foods</strong> &#8211; The US aim for a more ‘science-based’ approach to growing and processing food we eat which is shorthand for saying more chemicals, hence why the EU has been apprehensive about allowing this practice.</li><li><strong>More pus in your milk</strong> &#8211; The US allows double the amount of white blood cells in milk than the EU.</li><li><strong>More pesticides</strong> &#8211; Even vegans aren’t safe! The US allows higher amounts of pesticide residue on fruit and vegetables 72 of which are banned by the EU for their harmful effects.</li><li><strong>Unsafe baby food</strong> &#8211; A recent test of baby foods in the US found that 95% contained toxic metals, with 73% containing traces of arsenic. They also allow far higher levels of sugar.</li><li><strong>No more pasties</strong> &#8211; They want to get rid of geographically protected food such as Cornish pasties or Cumberland sausages &#8211; they would mass produce these products using chemicals in the US, put British farmers out of business and undercut the market.</li><li><strong>Race to the bottom</strong> &#8211; British farmers would no longer be able to compete with large American corporations undercutting the market thus they would in turn have to lower their quality and standards in order to remain in business.</li><li><strong>Bugs, hair and faeces</strong> &#8211; US producers are allowed to include up to 30 insect fragments in a 100g jar of peanut butter; as well as 11 rodent hairs in a 25g container of paprika; or 3mg of mammalian excreta (typically rat or mouse excrement) per each pound of ginger. The EU, however, does not allow the traces of any hair, excrement or insects in its food.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Our regulation on food quality is still not stringent enough and the quality of what we are eating is degrading, making us the second most obese nation in Europe after Malta. The last thing we need is the reintroduction of carcinogens, hormones and chemicals that we haven’t eaten in decades back into our diets. With wealth inequality increasing, the passing of this deal would affect poorer areas in more severe ways further increasing health inequalities between richer and poorer areas that has been highlighted as a pressing issue during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, it is repulsive to think that the government would even consider regressing on so many beneficial regulations on the health and safety of our food in return for the invasion of large American corporations and higher profit margins. Moreover, I lived in America for six months and, although they allow far lower standards of food quality, the prices of all food stuffs was extortionate. Grocery shopping in the USA was almost unaffordable for me; to buy fresh produce and cook every night became more expensive than eating out at the multitude of fast food and chain restaurants that occupied the streets next to me. It forces low income individuals and families into eating processed and unhealthy foods almost every day. This inevitably causes health problems and obesity that cannot be addressed because healthcare is far too expensive. It becomes a vicious cycle and it is one that is threatening the health of the UK with the possibility of this trade deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;It serves only to benefit large US corporations and the UK government in the long run with the general public losing out on both health and affordability.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This, ultimately, shows that were our food standards to be lowered in order for a successful US trade deal, it would not even have the small benefit of making our food cheaper. It serves only to benefit large US corporations and the UK government in the long run with the general public losing out on both health and affordability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how likely is this all to happen? It is integral to the success of this government to secure a trade deal with the USA as it was the basis of their election campaign. Thus, although the government has time and again claimed that it will refuse to regress on UK and EU food standards, it is becoming increasingly unlikely that the government would be able to secure a deal that does not include the introduction of US food standards. The US are aware of the UK’s need to secure a trade deal for both economic security and for the government to save face, so they are incredibly unlikely to budge during these negotiations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The election of Joe Biden could have a positive effect on this trade deal, but this will be largely unknown until next year. However, it is still unlikely as although he is most definitely the lesser of two evils, he cannot be looked upon as someone who will break the mould of the long line of US presidents bending over for powerful corporations and lobbyists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is, therefore, fundamental that we make it abundantly clear that we will not have our food standards, and indelibly, our health pillaged by powerful US corporations. We cannot rely on this government to do the right thing as time and time again they have proven their ineptitude and lack of care. It is instead up to the public to demonstrate that we will not accept this trade deal.

A pretty unremarkable occurrence, maybe. What is strange is that my last ancestor to have lived in Portugal was born 312 years ago, in the year 1708. In 1736, twenty-eight years later, my great-x7-grandmother made it to Amsterdam, fleeing the Portuguese Inquisition. The Inquisition didn’t end until the mid-nineteenth century, and had an estimated 40,000 victims, with thousands killed and tortured in public ceremonies (the vast majority were Jewish, while some were Muslims and Hindus in Goa, a Portuguese colony in India). In 2013, the Portuguese parliament decided to apologise by offering thousands of Sephardi Jews, including me, a path to citizenship; a country which I had visited on a family holiday once, and had no tangible connection to. In a sense, I feel like an imposter – a Portuguese citizen who can speak less than five words of language. But in another sense, if my Portuguese ancestors weren’t forced to leave their country of birth by the very virtue of practicing a minority religion, perhaps I would be no less Portuguese than someone born in Lisbon today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Citizenship of a nation-state is, of course, constructed. No one is <em>innately </em>British, Swedish, Guinean or Portuguese. As we’ve seen, it doesn’t even require birth within the borders of a country. Benedict Anderson, a political scientist, famously put it another way. For him, the nation ultimately only exists as an ‘imagined community’; created from above (‘the invention of tradition’), and below (the raw materials of local languages, dialects, and cultures). This may all be true, but the nation still has an almost irresistible, transcendental pull. It’s the pull to start rooting for Portugal at the next Olympics, or World Cup, or to convince yourself that Cristiano Ronaldo isn’t an irreconcilably smug arsehole. It’s even the pull to put up a Portuguese flag in your living room and add the national anthem to your Spotify playlist. But Portugal was also the country to terrorize and expel my ancestors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is Persecution Timeless?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, Sioux activist and academic Nick Estes published his book <em>Our History is the Future</em>, a story and manifesto of indigenous resistance. In it, he explains indigenous notions of time:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“There is no separation between past and present, meaning that an alternative future is also determined by our understanding of our past. Our history is the future.”</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This conception of time is specific to indigenous North American communities and rooted in their unique culture and belief system – it can’t be appropriated. But for all individuals born into a traditionally persecuted ethnicity, race or religion, Estes’s title in an inescapable fact of life – <em>Our History is the Future. </em>That legacy, of how our ancestors were persecuted, is unavoidable in how we construct our identities. Ta-Nehisi Coates, an African American essayist for the <em>Atlantic</em>, grapples with the idea of citizenship of a country whose democracy was founded on slavery, where the ingrained structures of white supremacy perpetuate modern-day slavery (the incarceration of African Americans) to this day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a British Jew, this transgenerational legacy of persecution feels in many ways less ‘real’. I’m lucky enough to be (not always) shielded from many direct experiences of discrimination. Yet, a 2018 CNN poll showed more than a quarter of Europeans believe Jews have too much influence in business and finance, an antisemitic trope as old as time; nearly a quarter believe we have too much influence in conflict and wars around the world. The defacing of Jewish graves in France with swastikas is a regular occurrence. <em>One in twelve </em>UK adults believe that the scale of the Holocaust has been exaggerated. In March 2019, our current Attorney General shamelessly spouted the far-right conspiracy theory of ‘cultural Marxism’. Antisemitism, whatever its manifestation now – as Holocaust denial or the same old canards – is as permanent as it was in eighteenth-century Portugal. As a British (and now also Portuguese) Jew, therefore, the reality of antisemitism is part of how I live my life – my identity. It is rooted in what my ancestors faced, in whatever country they had been forced into: from inquisitions, pogroms, or genocide. It is also rooted how society speaks to me today. My history is the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Confronting History</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why, then, should I form any connection to the country I’m a citizen of? Whatever your Daily Mail columnist might say, no one has a duty to. Should I accept the seemingly obvious conclusion that I’m Jewish, not a member of any other nation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are valid and difficult questions. The lesson I think I have learned, however, is that as a member of a historically oppressed minority, taking on, and embracing, citizenship is not an affirmation of everything a country stands for – nor its past. Nor is it a fruitless endeavour, even as discrimination permeates. It is a conscious rejection of how that country treated my ancestors, affirming their experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What Benedict Anderson perhaps misses is how nations can be constructed <em>backwards </em>in time, as I draw my identity as part of a country back to how my ancestors were forced to (or not) live. Above all, this is why knowledge of a country’s past, and oppression of minorities, is crucial. Britain needs to get over the institutionalised terror of facing this. Portugal should be commended for doing so. History cannot be shaped into the most comfortable narrative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/harryfranks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Harry Franks</a>&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Comment your thoughts and rate this article below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/harryfranks/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9b9a40cbdaba84cf01e98b4f6bfaad06?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Harry Franks\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/harryfranks/\">Harry Franks</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

If not belonging to the privileged demographic who have received honorary pleasure of experiencing this first hand – maybe as a young child baring witness to the classical performative charade found within the heights of Blackpool Tower – it’s almost a guaranteed recognisable concept. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Familiarity is found through hearing of this phenomenon through books, media and tales of circus-goers. What with recent anguish directed at exploitation of circus animals, the circus environment portrays itself as a controversial leisure activity. Similarly to the circus, a speculating performance also appears in the world of environmental ‘wokeness’. Tricks and illusion exist delivered by governmental bodies and industry whilst unaware members of the public latch onto mis-directing practices of ditching their plastic straws and bowing down to alternative consumption claiming inclusivity and environmental protection. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arguably, performances of attitudes prioritising ecosystems, revealing little transparency in the methods behind the madness, present an anthropogenic circus of government clowns, an overwhelming pressure to juggle ‘sustainable behaviours’ in view of an easily-swayed, unfairly uneducated audience. How has it come about that putting our planet first has led to such a large degree of manipulation encompassing behaviours that are suited to feed to ego and reputation rather than knowledge and community ability to do better?</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We look initially to the ringmaster – those wealthiest not just in abstract concepts of monetary flow but also influence. Presenting minuscule consumption habits such as switching to ‘free-range’ eggs and paper straws over plastic as proactive. This is an illusive mask for externalities caused by macroeconomics (large-scale behaviours and decision making) such as mass deforestation instigated by the normalisation of animal agriculture. The fear of clowns is a common one – reasonably founded as there is arguably little scarier than individuals with evident skill, impossibility to ignore who are continually choosing to disillusion. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-center\"><p>&#8220;A fine line is walked between falsely reassuring the public of environmental prioritisation yet ultimately ensuring the protection of financial assets and economic growth over natural and human capital&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feigned ignorance from government bodies presents as similarly comical when claims of new green energy budgets reveal that two thirds of spending transpires from previous green projects that failed to utilise original budgets. We then look to our musicians and tight-rope walkers; those that drown out lack of governmental and industrial transparency with noise of fake news and distraction. This occurs largely through the weaponisation of media outlets. A fine line is walked between falsely reassuring the public of environmental prioritisation yet ultimately ensuring the protection of financial assets and economic growth over natural and human capital. Arguably, truth could also be considered a scarce resource in todays age. Just as those with a basic education in neoclassical economics would understand, it could be framed that there is no supply without demand. The majority of us are included in the audience; with perceived lack of influence yet without our ticket sales, evident interest and loyalty would stagnate and ultimately prevent circus antics from continuing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore – social hierarchy within the audience, dictating perspective and consumer perks (harnessing wealth to comply with sustainable consumption vs succumbing to cheaper, most accessible yet damaging fast fashion outlets), the majority are faced with insufficient capacity to partake. The less privileged are scolded for inability to go along with the show through following the latest ‘green fads’. Circus animals have not been forgotten, the victims of performative environmentalism weep at hidden fossil fuel investments as further pollution drives all species from their homes and away from vital resources; voiceless at the expense of the rhetoric that ‘the show must go on’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as the novelties of the circus transition into a relic of ‘better times’, so should theatrics of shallow environmental tactics. Bottom-up change can demand for this; us as the audience to a slowing decaying world have abilities to hold figurative ringleaders accountable. We must be seated equally where individual and community ideas and capacities are acknowledged. Upholding more equal wealth and resource distribution can be achieved through buying local and pre-loved goods – dismantling control and decisions enforced by a singular ringleader, representative of the 1%. This encompasses industrial leaders – companies and brands are responsible for reallocation of sustainable resource use rather than utilising recycling incentives as agent to consume further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through re-choreographing the discourse of ‘we are what we consume’ and prioritising community ties within our earths carrying capacity, little value lies in continuing to fund the circus of of false promise, hidden externalities and deception – the theatrics fall apart. However, it would prove to be further trickery to place the majority of burden and shame on individuals when true salvation lies in politics and governmental institution. Raised carbon prices simultaneous with green energy subsidies pushes global adaptation from a much more influential standpoint – the world stage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exposure and critique of governmental failure denounces comical patronisation; it’s time for our world leaders to stop clowning around. Media outlets must seek to inform rather than to entertain; underpinning environmental issues which are often true cause of war, poverty and contributor to the mass pandemic we are at present forced to speculate and actively perform in ourselves. Victims must be freed from compliancy – their rights to coexist equally with the western world upheld, demanding cohesion with justice amongst not only the human population but also amongst species. Collective thought and cultural change continues to evolve, proving perspectives of social norms and values to be infectious – herd mentality deciphers to the circus environment to now be largely problematic and outdated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could the same attitudes and practices transpire towards green washing continuing to mask disaster capitalism? Ultimately, performative environmentalism won’t reverse climate change – financial and egotistical gain will cease to progress without the ecosystem resources they so desperately depend upon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/emmahubberstey/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Emma Hubberstey</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Comment your thoughts and rate this article below!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/emmahubberstey/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/39c828c57dc3c96a51068fac1f2b78ac?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Emma Hubberstey\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/emmahubberstey/\">Emma Hubberstey</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Right wing American activist and Trump advocator Candace Owens had this to say:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-center\"><p>“There is no society that can survive without strong men. The East knows this. In the west, the steady feminization of our men at the same time that Marxism is being taught to our children is not a coincidence. It is an outright attack. Bring back manly men.’’</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"622\" height=\"631\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/harrytwitter.png?resize=622%2C631&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2180\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/harrytwitter.png?w=622&amp;ssl=1 622w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/harrytwitter.png?resize=296%2C300&amp;ssl=1 296w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>While some prominent right-wing figures (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/1328342542287589381?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ben Shapiro</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1328457990568103939\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Donald Trump Jr</a> to name names) encouraged and expanded on her remarks, Owens’ tweet was mostly met with fiery backlash and outrage. Many men quickly leapt to Styles’ defence. Actor Zac Braff <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zachbraff/status/1328417293827641345\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tweeted a photo</a> from the shoot stating ‘our whole lives boys and men are told we need to be manly. Life is short. Be whatever the fuck you want to be.’ Lord of the Rings star <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elijahwood/status/1328419112737861633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1328419112737861633%7Ctwgr%5E&amp;ref_url=https://www.insider.com/harry-styles-candace-owens-vogue-cover-celebrities-fans-react-2020-11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Elijah Wood replied</a> to Owens ‘I think you’ve missed the definition of what a man is. Masculinity alone does not make a man.’ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HarryShumJr/status/1329104707902574594\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Actor Harry Shum Jr also tweeted</a> ‘being comfortable in your own skin as a man is manly. However that is expressed.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Candace Owens has hit a nerve here and this is not the first time. Indeed, she is no stranger to controversy; a black author and political commentator, she has become increasingly famous in recent months for her pro-Trump activism and persistent slamming of the opposition. Founder of the Blexit movement – urging black Americans to abandon the Democrats – she has just released her new book ‘Blackout: How Black America can make its Second Escape from the Democratic Plantation’, which has topped the New York Times best seller list for 9 weeks running. Her book controversially pledges African Americans to abandon their ties with the Democrats and move over to the right.<a href=\"#_ftn1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only is Owens an author, but she has also proved to be a fierce political and social critic. Between 2017-2019 she worked as communications director for the right-wing organisation Turning Point USA which advocates for conservative principles to be implemented in high-school, college and university campuses. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO/status/987450257159077888\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">When speaking at UCLA in 2018</a>, Owens argued with Black Lives Matter protesters, calling them ‘overprivileged Americans’ who had a ‘victim mentality’ and who were ‘not living through anything right now’. She then later tweeted video footage of the clash, calling the protestors a ‘<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO/status/987450257159077888\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bunch of whiny toddlers</a> pretending to be oppressed for attention.’ More recently, she has been circulating in the media for her comments on the murder of George Floyd. In a <a href=\"https://fb.watch/1TJwp7KgaG/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Facebook video</a> Owens shared on the 3rd June, she argued ‘racially motivated police brutality is a myth’ and then refused to uphold George Floyd as a martyr for the <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"456\" height=\"228\" src=\"\">black American community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NRA.png?resize=640%2C320&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2182\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NRA.png?w=949&amp;ssl=1 949w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NRA.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NRA.png?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Owens is a social media giant with a 2.8 million twitter following and, despite her account being suspended earlier this year after she encouraged the residents of Michigan to defy coronavirus stay-at-home rules and go to work, she remains persistent with her opinions. She continues to spread <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO/status/1327653367754219523\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">fake news</a> about the legitimacy of Joe Biden’s presidential victory, adamantly claiming the election was rigged and stolen from the Republicans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of politics, Owens likes to have a good crack at contemporary feminism as well. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realcandaceo/status/1006278364708077569?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">She tweeted</a> that the premise of the ‘Me Too’ movement (a movement that fights against sexual abuse and assault) is that women are ‘stupid, weak and inconsequential’. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J-csrBJoxI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">On an episode of The Candace Owens Show</a>, she recalled a question from a Washington Post journalist about the existence of white supremacy in America, to which she responded, ‘the closest thing I’ve ever seen to it in my life is the radicalised feminist movement.’ Not only is she relighting the archaic belief that women’s voices are not worthy of being heard (any irony appears drowned out by her own strident tones), but she is also casting doubt on victims of sexual abuse and assault who have been so brave in coming forward. Her choice of the feminist movement as the worst example of white supremacy she has ever seen is almost unfathomable when we consider the following: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54210448\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Breonna Taylor</a>’s family have still not received justice for her death after she was fatally shot in her apartment by Louisville policemen. It took <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52623151\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">74 days for the McMichaels to be arrested</a> after they murdered Ahmaud Arbery in broad daylight. George Floyd’s final words, ‘I can’t breathe’, as he was starved of oxygen before dying have become a protest chant uttered by millions. These are sadly just some of the recent tragedies, and they only begin to scratch the surface of the long-embedded issues of racism and brutality against black people in America.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, where Candace Owens finds brewing leftist anarchy in Harry Styles clad in a Gucci ballgown, many of us instead find liberation and hope for the future. As Styles said in his <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/harry-styles-cover-december-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Vogue cover story</a>,</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-center\"><p>“clothes are there to have fun and experiment with and play with. What’s really exciting is that all of these lines are just kind of crumbling away. When you take away ‘there’s clothes for men and there’s clothes for women,’ once you remove any barriers, obviously you open up an arena in which you can play […] it’s like anything – anytime you’re putting barriers up in your own life, you’re just limiting yourself. There’s so much joy to be had in playing with clothes. I’ve never really thought too much about what it means &#8211; it just becomes this extended part of creating something.’’</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>What Styles is doing is ignoring archaic notions of masculinity and femininity and in turn becoming a beacon of hope for many who have long felt restricted by these binaries. By inverting stereotypes through fashion and wearing garments that champion gender fluidity, he is helping to re-conceptualise a more open definition of what it means to be a man today. While Candace Owens’ idea of masculinity works for some, for many it is an entrapment. With International Men’s Day having just passed by, author Matt Haig <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://twitter.com/matthaig1/status/1329355887329284103\" target=\"_blank\"> tweeted</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-center\"><p>“Men die by suicide in silence because they feel trapped and locked inside an idea of masculinity that falsely equates strength with silence. It is okay to have a mind that goes wrong. It is okay to feel and cry and be flawed and feel weak from time to time. It is okay to be you.’’</p><p></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of shutting down men who break away from toxic notions of masculinity, we must instead praise and encourage them. Harry Styles is a figure of male empowerment because he provides an alternative masculinity to the traditional notion which simply no longer fits with many men of today.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/democratic-edge-in-party-identification-narrows-slightly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">A report released by Pew Research Centre</a> earlier this year showed that 83% of black American voters vote or lean towards the Democrat party, compared with 10% of those who identify or vote Republican.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>By <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/larakeville/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lara Keville</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Comment your thoughts and rate this article below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/larakeville/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76bbebf22b4349a8a5bf356f09eb45b5?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Lara Keville\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/larakeville/\">Lara Keville</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

They are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Any online recipe you read has to start with 4 paragraphs of anecdote about how the author either inherited the recipe from their now-dead-gran, or found it whilst travelling the depths of the Badab-e-Surt on a transformational journey in 2016.</li><li>Any article written since April 1st 2020 has to start with “Remember when X&#8230;” as though being asked to stay at home for a few months has rendered us all completely incapable of remembering the past. With that in mind…</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember when we could travel? That was good wasn’t it. Queueing for two hours at Stanstead on the way in. Queuing for 3 hours at Luton on the way back with a sunburn and no battery left. A hostel down an alleyway that smells faintly of piss. Standing outside a bar for 2 hours waiting patiently to get that Instagram snap so your friends would know you were having a good time when really you’re covered in bed bug bites, and you and your partner have just had an argument about how to pronounce <a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/tzatziki\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tzatziki</a>*? Travel, yeah? Amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, the best thing about travel (whether you agree or not) is the food. Whilst this does lead me to question what the 38m tourists a year who visit the UK are thinking, at least if you’re from here, you can go almost anywhere else and have a better meal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that in mind, here’s HERD’s first ever cooking column (probably). We’re going to cook stuff from abroad.

Netflix is rarely one to disappoint with their originals, and ‘The Queen’s Gambit’ is no exception.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Set in America during the fifties and sixties, it takes viewers on a journey through the life of Beth Harmon; from her troubled childhood to the sometimes questionable, yet nonchalant, love affairs she finds herself in. But the one constant of the programme is Beth’s passion and unwavering skill for the age-old game, chess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The show is bursting with time-fitting political and social comments, such as the American view on communism and their relationship with the U.S.S.R, and the rise of the Black Panther Party. The era in which it’s set is culturally significant, and the show is full of countless nods to this; not only the score, but the brilliant set design and an unbeatable range of costumes which reflect the transition from the reserved fifties into the relaxed, individual-centric sixties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott Frank and Allan Scott developed the show from the novel, the former being an Academy Award winning screenplay writer behind the adaptations of critically acclaimed films ‘Get Shorty’ and ‘Marley &amp; Me’. Obviously, the success of the show isn’t just down to the screenplay, the original novel of the same name written by Walter Tevis in 1983 combines the themes of feminism, addiction and, of course, chess – a trifecta that’s atypical but insanely interesting and gripping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a woman in the world of chess, Beth finds herself battling with men who think she’s ridiculous for even attempting to play (“girls don’t play chess”) and mad for entering top tier competitions without having competed before. And they’re not wrong. The era that the show is set in is a time where women were mainly seen and not heard, using their free time to engage in “social clubs” or other activities fit for the abilities of a dainty soon-to-be housewife. However, Beth defies these boundaries and proves herself to be a more than competent chess player, going on to beat everyone she plays – repeatedly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just Beth’s character that defies boundaries that we usually see in TV and film tropes. The way that most of the men react to their loss to Beth is admirable and honourable, showing an understanding that it doesn’t matter who their opponent is and simply appreciating the skill of the player. This was refreshing to watch, countering the common narrative in TV where men throw a huff or deny the outcome when a woman can do something better than they can. Maybe this is because of Beth’s fierce, take-no-shit attitude, or maybe the world of chess is filled with more progressive players and observers than something like football where it is sadly still a popular idea that male players are better than female players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flashbacks are tied to issues that Beth faces later on down the line in a highly detailed and admirable manner. For example, when Beth’s biological mother is burning books and clothes outside their trailer, Beth picks up a book called ‘Monomial Representations and Symmetric Presentations’ by Alice Harmon, her mother. Earlier in that scene you see a vial of pills fall from her mother’s hand, probably the same pills that Beth later finds herself addicted to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme of addiction in this show is very clear, with many characters having their own substance problem that they work through (Jolene, who is clean later on, but realises Beth still takes the tranquilisers) or continues to suffer with. However, the root of addiction is not really pinpointed as different characters have their own histories with alcohol and drugs. In Beth’s case, she began taking them as prescribed by the orphanage nurse, just like every other orphan there. The idea that a nine-year-old, albeit one that has had a traumatic past, should be given a benzodiazepine is ludicrous in this day and age, but in the fifties it was the norm to remedy anything with a pill. The little green pills are recurring throughout the show, with Beth’s adoptive mother taking them after being told she needs “more tranquillity”, even though she is clearly depressed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beth’s introduction to the world of the “green one” is to numb her mind. This numbness seems to be something that Beth chases for the rest of the show through drugs and alcohol. It relaxes her, helping her forget the memories that trouble her but also brings a part of her mind to life, a part that allows her to play chess in her mind. The way the chess pieces dance across the ceiling at night brings a sense of magic to the game and for the viewer, a true understanding of just how talented Beth really is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The detail in the show is as intricate and carefully selected as an opening move by a grand-master chess player. Transitions between the present and childhood flashbacks are immaculate, tying scenes together seamlessly. The way the production and editorial team executed this show leaves you with an understanding of Beth, her passion, her relationship with drugs and alcohol, and definitely a burning desire to learn to play chess.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/madiapthorpe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">By Madi Apthorpe</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Comment your thoughts and rate this article below!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/madiapthorpe/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ab4fae47fb7f7a61ec381588620efeb1?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Madi Apthorpe\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/madiapthorpe/\">Madi Apthorpe</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>What do you think of when you hear the phrase ‘sexual assault’? What images come to mind?&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">It’s a loaded term that, to my mind, doesn’t reach far enough to describe the spectrum of sexual objectification, harassment, and physical harm that many of us live with the risk of. Having lived in this world as a woman for 20 years, and been active in feminist communities, I have easily come to the realisation that sexual assault, or at least accounting for the risk of it, has somehow become just a part of life for almost all women. The phrase ‘sexual assault’ leaps out of the page, it shocks, but the reality of it is ignored, undermined, and passed over.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our culture is a culture that permits sexual assault. It is a culture where sexual assault is normal, and that can be shown both through statistics, and through lived experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My friends and I have been assaulted in clubs, on bridges, at festivals, in our own homes, in alleyways. Alone, with each other, surrounded by hundreds of silent bystanders. Wearing crop tops, winter coats, underwear, long sleeved tops and jeans. By friends, strangers, acquaintances, Tinder dates, colleagues. In almost every conceivable situation. Despite our strongly held beliefs, not all rapes are strangers in alleyways. In fact 66%, are committed by someone known to the victim. Even if we stay at home, and only interact with people known to us, there is always a risk. I think some men would be astonished if women and non-binary people recounted a list of all the time they’ve wasted, the money they’ve spent, and the opportunities they’ve missed out on due to the risk of assault. The extra Ubers, the keys between knuckles every time we walk in the dark, the missed travel experiences, the gripping fear that comes when a strange man approaches.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, despite all of our precautions, there is no where we can go, and nothing we can do, to escape from the grim reality of objectification and sexual assault. Sexual assault is the price women pay to take part in daily life. It is not a price we choose to pay, but there is no decision we can make that fully takes away the risk of being sexually assaulted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h4>It&#8217;s Right to be Angry</h4>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This terrifying reality is perhaps why so many ignore this problem. Many just don’t think about it, with good reason. Instead, many others fall back on ancient myths that blame survivors for being assaulted, to convince themselves that this is not something they have to worry about, they are sensible, they would never put themselves in that position. But we are all put in that position by others, time and time again. If, as I have, you spend a lot of time thinking about the gross statistics, the millions of lived experiences behind those numbers, it can cripple you with anger. It is beyond terrifying that as a culture, as a world, as a society, this is permitted. I am filled with a deep, deep pit of rage that we live in a society where it is rare to find a teenager that has never been harassed or assaulted. And yet I have to apologise when I get angry when talking about sexual assault? I have to coddle “not all men” – but if all of my female friends have been harassed, who&#8217;s doing the harassing? Why am I considered ‘rude’ for caring about this? I&#8217;m tired of only being able to vent about this to my female friends, or else risk being called a man hater, or being told I’m hurting someone&#8217;s feelings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I was groped at a festival, I didn’t feel able to tell many people except the friends I was with. I’d kissed the perpetrator. I’d started it, so when they took it too far and breached my consent, I felt like it was my fault. A friend I was with that night was also assaulted, more seriously, by someone she had never initiated contact with, the person behind her in a queue. Not one person in that queue, except our friend, stepped in. She also felt guilty, and like she could tell no one. We were drunk and wearing our best party clothes, so I didn&#8217;t feel like I could. In reality, I know it&#8217;s not our fault. But I also know that women are told to hide our bodies under layers, to stay sober, to fold ourselves smaller and smaller so we won&#8217;t be noticed by men. So society tells us the fault was with us. Why didn’t we make ourselves even smaller?</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a patriarchal problem but seems to run deeper than other problems of sexist origin. Sexual violence is endemic everywhere, even in nations with higher equality between sexes. For example, Iceland has the lowest gender gap according to the UN and is held up as a paragon for sexual equality. However, women there face disproportionate sexual violence. ¼ Icelandic women have been raped or sexually assaulted in their lives, compared to 1/10 of European women. Of course, some of that difference can be put down to reporting, as more equal cultures foster a more permissive attitude to reporting sexual assault.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what can we do? The judicial system is clearly not working- all forms of rape have been illegal in the UK since 1991 (yes, that late), and yet over 85,000 women and 12,000 men experience rape, attempted rape or sexual assault by penetration every year. Although this is not just an issue that affects women, and the impact of assault on men should not be ignored, the figures show that women and non-binary people are the main victims. And our system fails these victims. Only 1.7% of reported rapes in 2019 were actually prosecuted. Pause to let that figure sink in. This figure also only includes reported rapes. Many go unreported, and harassment is much more common and less likely to be reported.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The justice system is not working, and it works even less when sexual assault is viewed intersectionally. Disabled women were almost twice as likely to have experienced sexual assault in the last year than non-disabled women, and yet our court system is poorly set up for anyone to go through the gruelling, complex, and often unsuccessful process of giving witness to assault, let alone those with severe disabilities. Trans women are also more vulnerable to sexual assault but may be ridiculed or have their gender identity question under investigation. As Black Lives Matter has exposed, the justice system is also systematically biased against people of colour, creating issues over unfair rape trials that involve survivors or perpetrators of colour. Our justice system is a reflection of our society: deeply flawed when it comes to sexual assault.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What Next?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what next? Where do we go from here? I spoke to Nina Burrowes, a psychologist and activist whose work centres around sexual harm. She is the co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.consentcollective.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Consent Collective</a>, an organisation using collective expertise to help other organisations, such as universities and businesses, respond to sexual assault. She is also a patron of Edinburgh Rape Crisis Centre. She started off working in prisons, and the trajectory of her working life demonstrates how insidiously sexual assault has crept into every corner of our lives: Burrowes has centred her work around the topic of sexual harm, and she goes where that topic takes her. And it has taken her almost everywhere: “to court, to police stations, to rape crisis centres, and to prison, to universities and workplaces.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where the Consent Collective comes in, as a vehicle to help communities respond to sexual violence. This means including everyone in the work of combatting and responding to sexual violence, not just those who are normally seen as specialists. Shortly after starting her work in criminal justice, Burrowes realised that specialist campaigns were not changing much. Workshops with judges about sexual harm, or retraining police officers, or a public campaign on harassment, none of that can even “scratch the surface” of how our society permits sexual harm. In her words, most current campaigns are simply “tinkering around the edges” of a fundamental societal issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what we discussed most. As can be seen through anecdotal evidence, the stories of hundreds and thousands of women, and statistics, sexual harm is endemic, and an accepted part of life in the so-called ‘enlightened West’.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Women are left thinking, well, where do we go from here? We can change the laws, we can protest in the streets, we can report assaults to the police, but until we change our culture, little will fundamentally alter. One of the main problems with the way our culture views sexual harm, according to Burrowes, is an oversized focus on the individual. If we were to look at the socio-political context, we would see that sexual harm is not just the act of an evil or pathological individual, but also the act of the society that enabled it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is hard to disagree when Burrowes tells me that rapists and assaulters operate in a society that “endorses their behaviour”, a system that has done “almost nothing” to prevent these acts from happening. It is easy enough for society to condemn the evil rapist, but harder to condemn our friends who cross lines with consent and who joke about rape. As long as we are in a culture where we tell women how to avoid sexual harm, rather than telling men not to commit it, any tinkering to our court system will have a negligible impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sexual harm is clearly not a new problem. A common angle for commentators to take is to blame the current prevalence of sexual assault on increased reporting or, even better, internet porn. We aren’t the problem; the anonymous violent porn of the internet is. However porn is simply a consumer project: a reflection of our desires. This is a disturbing realisation: as Burrowes asks, “when all of porn is about men dominating women, I think men must feel massively disempowered. What&#8217;s wrong?” When the thing that turns men on most is violent domination of helpless women, it suggests that they feel very out of control in their own lives. This throws up many questions about toxic masculinity, gender norms, and how they are affecting potential perpetrators of sexual violence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The normalisation of violent sexual behaviour by porn is clearly a negative, but it is important to realise, as Burrowes explains, that porn is “plugging a gap in terms of bad sex education.” Young people go to porn to learn about sex, so if they are normalising the damaging practices of porn, is it our education system’s fault for not being more open with young people about the pleasures and risks of sex? This leads us to one of Burrowes’ suggestions for changing the way we think about sexual assault: better education about consent at every level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important for us to question what we consider education to be? Is it learning facts, or is it helping someone to become the best version of the adult they can be, teaching emotional and social intelligence? The way we currently teach consent, as one-off sessions every year, ignores that consent is something “fundamental to everything”, not just to sex. Burrowes argues that consent is fundamental to every aspect of human life, and is a notion we are born with, but that we unlearn through society. One of the first things a child understands is the ability to say no but, growing up, our instinct to say and respect no is repressed. If we want to make respect for sexual consent the norm, we first need to rehabilitate consent in every aspect of our lives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of alternatives, we have to realise that our current judicial and punitive system is not working. In the disturbing words of Burrowes, we must remember that “the vast majority of people who cause sexual harm have never encountered justice, and have never had any help to help them not commit harm in the future.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We assume that courts and prisons are the best way to deal with sexual harm, because it is all we know, but we have never asked what a different way might look like. It is clearly not an issue valued by the powerful. As Burrowes points out, we have so much talent in this country, and yet most have “never been asked to apply that talent” to the question of how to create institutions that can reduce sexual harm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h4>A Radical Solution</h4>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the options considered for changing the paradigm around sexual assault are deeply rooted in the current system. An example of this is restorative justice, which I believe is a step in the right direction, but Burrowes argues is a product of our existing system, “a black hole” that sucks away productive and creative efforts. To Burrowes, we must remember the words of Audre Lorde, “the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house.” We must go outside of the box.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another issue with restorative justice is that it pressures victims to forgive, when Burrowes insists that anger is usually the correct response to sexual harm, especially in a society where we know that there is a high likelihood of it happening again. To return to the example of Iceland, a nation that fulfills all of the statistics for gender equality, but is experiencing a crisis of sexual harm, Burrowes sees this as an example of the perils sticking to the current system. With sexual harm, we can affect measures that seem “rational and intelligent”, but until the “deeply ingrained emotional aspects that feed into sexual violence” are addressed, little will change. The problem of sexual harm in our society is not a problem of rational intelligence- most people believe rape is wrong. The problem is “deeply ingrained and emotional”, because people may believe sexual harm is wrong, but due to deeply held emotional narratives, won’t see what they are doing as sexual harm. This is why Burrowes is more interested in examining how communities respond to infractions of consent, responses that are more nuanced than plain punishment, which doesn’t disturb the underlying issues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a different system means facing very difficult decisions, some of which can seem counterintuitive, such as abandoning the natural desire for punishment. Burrowes argues that we have to make a difficult choice regarding our value systems. To her, the priority is always supporting a perpetrator of sexual harm to never harm again, even if this means they are not punished. This is a radical idea, and one that our country struggles with; voters in the UK can have a punitive mindset, ignoring rehabilitative policies for any crime, let alone sexual harm. What we need is more “wisdom and compassion”. It may feel very hard to extend compassion to those who have inflicted sexual harm on another, and is an idea that I myself struggle with, but it may be the only way to end sexual harm. We cannot solve a problem without asking ourselves why it happens. As Burrowes argues, “harming someone else is always a sign that there’s something wrong,” and yet sexual harm is so common, so why are we not addressing what’s wrong. Again, this does not mean forgiving those who commit acts of sexual violence, there is a clear difference. To anyone who confuses the two, Burrowes has a clear message: “society has no right to ask anybody to forgive right now. Society has done nowhere near enough to stop this from happening.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Burrowes’ vision of a society where we ask why sexual harm is committed, and stem the causes, rather than punishing without question, is an alluring one, but is it possible? Burrowes acknowledges that her aims are ambitious and sees these changes as “generations away”. So what can we do as individuals to get change to occur sooner? We can challenge assumptions around sexual assault, we can confront our friends when their behaviour is problematic, we can treat survivors with empathy, we can try to understand sexual harm as a complex issue, rather than simplifying it to an evil deed. However, what’s most important is to keep raising awareness, to speak up, and to let the world know that we will no longer be complacent about sexual assault. We will not pay this price any longer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>By <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/millielord/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Millie Lord</a></strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Comment your thoughts and rate this article below!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/millielord/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9e8c2bb3a150a5b13852330c65f85605?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Millie Lord\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/millielord/\">Millie Lord</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Police were called to various locations in London on the <a href=\"https://www.mylondon.news/news/east-london-news/1000-people-attend-east-london-19203827\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Saturday night</a>, including an illegal rave in Tower Hamlets in East London where it is thought that 1000 people had gathered. The Metropolitan Police in particular are beginning to rack up a large stash of sound systems and DJ sets as they stormed a further 10 large illegal events that flouted the coronavirus rules. A rave of 500 people in a warehouse was also reported in <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/huge-illegal-raves-broken-up-22938825\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Yate</a>, near Bristol as well as an unlicensed gathering of 300 people in a farmer’s field in Wigan, Greater Manchester. The farmer returned from a hard day’s work in the fields to the unusual sight of a large crowd of people bopping amongst his crops to thumping electronic music. Police officers intervened to break up the event but in turn experienced violence from some members of the public. Seven police vehicles also had their tyres slashed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The events of last weekend are unsettling echoes of the disorder that we have already seen occur during earlier months of the coronavirus pandemic. On a weekend in mid-June around 6,000 people attended two illegal raves in <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/14/six-thousand-people-attend-two-illegal-raves-greater-manchester\" target=\"_blank\">Greater Manchester</a>. They were so large the police were unable to regulate or control them. At one of the raves in Carrington, Trafford, a young woman was raped and 3 men were stabbed. One of the men was left with life-threatening injuries. At another rave in Failsworth, Oldham, which was reported to have had up to 4000 people at the scene, a young man died of a suspected drug overdose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such signs of social unrest have been rearing their heads during these last few months and it comes as no surprise. The <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54520521\" target=\"_blank\">UK unemployment rate</a> has reached its highest level in over three years, as the pandemic continues to leave working people economically vulnerable. The Office for National Statistics reported that between June and August an estimated <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/october2020\" target=\"_blank\">1.5 million people were unemployed</a>, 209,000 more than the previous year. Those who had been made redundant between June and August stood at an overwhelming <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/october2020\" target=\"_blank\">227,000</a>.  Young people are being disproportionately affected, with 16-24 year olds making up 300,000 of those who are <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54520521\" target=\"_blank\">out of work</a>. New statistics released by the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54884592\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ONS today</a> show there is a record-low number of 16-24 year olds in employment, decreasing this quarter by 174,000 to a new ground-breaking low of 3.52 million. Combine high rates of unemployment with the closure of hospitality industries, a dying cultural scene and limited opportunity for socialising and you can understand the frustration and fury rippling amongst the young.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is true that young people also account for a large proportion of those that have been impacted by the government’s furlough scheme. The Job Retention Scheme, which has now been extended to March 2021, pays furloughed employees 80% of their wages, up to £2500 per month. The scheme was originally introduced back in March to provide economic support for those who were out of work due to the pandemic: either the forced closure of their workplaces or the failure of their businesses due to Covid. Yet employment losses are still high, with young people amongst those worst hit. Research has shown that workers aged between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/29/furlough-how-uk-jobs-market-has-fared-during-the-pandemic-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">16 to 25</a> are more than twice as likely to lose their jobs than their older counterparts. For those on furlough, the possibility of redundancy looms like a dark cloud. Those already unemployed are left bleakly scrolling through the limited job opportunities on offer. Many of the young are left in an uncomfortable state of limbo which is shrouded with uncertainty.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their futures are therefore proving to be frighteningly unclear. The economy is in a continual state of decline due to the pandemic, with the government having already borrowed <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52663523\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">208.5 billion</a> this year alone compared to the 55 billion that was intended. The young are becoming increasingly restless and claustrophobic in their homes. Many are understandably craving an outlet. The rave culture satisfies this desire for escapism, and over the past few months we have seen it return in all its carnivalesque fury. The rave becomes a utopia for many, where the young can come together in solidarity and escape what is at this time a bleak, anxiety-fuelled reality. It becomes a space of temporary liberation when our lives are increasingly shaped by restrictions. The very rules and boundaries that are squashing people’s freedom are given a location to be vigorously transgressed. With the second lockdown now in full swing, we can only wait and see whether these illegal raves are now here to stay.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/larakeville/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lara Keville</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Comment your thoughts and rate this article below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/larakeville/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76bbebf22b4349a8a5bf356f09eb45b5?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Lara Keville\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/larakeville/\">Lara Keville</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">At some point in the mid to late noughties, Borat entered your life. Maybe you gasped, laughed and gagged at the film yourself, or perhaps you were forced to hear “my name-a-Borat!” relentlessly quoted in some kind of strange Slavic accent. Either way, the film was as popular as it was controversial, and it was hard not to be curious about what “that guy from Ali G” was doing. So, what <em>was</em> he doing? And what is he doing now in Borat’s second instalment? The answer: weaponising comedy in the interests of activism, but who are the real victims in his process, and does the end justify the means?</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The infamy of the first <em>Borat</em> is not surprising. Its lighter moments include a live chicken being unleashed onto a busy subway and Borat squeezing into that now iconic fluorescent ‘mankini’.&nbsp; But some of the ‘jokes’ were far more offensive. The protagonist repeatedly spouts deeply racist, sexist, antisemitic and homophobic ideas and stereotypes. For example, at a Texan rodeo, Borat sings, “throw the Jew down the well!” to a crowd, with many singing along with him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may hear this shocking anti-semitism coming out of Borat’s mouth and argue the film is simply perpetuating hate and giving license and ammunition to people who wish to do the same &#8211; and you would not be alone. At the time of the first film’s release, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) warned that it risked <a href=\"http://www.adl.org/PresRele/Mise_00/4898_00.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">“reinforcing bigotry”</a>. It was also banned entirely from almost every country in the Arab world, and Kazakhstan launched a multi-million dollar &#8220;Heart of Eurasia&#8221; campaign to counter the negative impacts <em>Borat </em>had on how their country was perceived globally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly, Borat the character offends, but his creator, Sacha Baron Cohen, has a very different agenda. Cohen, who is Jewish, has challenged bigotry and intolerance throughout his life. As a teenager in the UK, he marched once against the Fascist National Front and again to abolish Apartheid. As an undergraduate, Cohen wrote his thesis on the civil rights movement in America, and as a comedian he aims to (in his own words): “Use characters to get people to let down their guard and reveal what they actually believe, including their own prejudice.” With outrageous lines, such as “throw the Jew down the well”, Cohen is not asking you to laugh at his character but instead to observe those who are singing along with him. Borat’<em>s </em>behaviour is abhorrent but fictional and serves as a honey pot to expose the real hatred felt and tolerated by everyone, from unsuspecting shop owners to very public figures within government and high-profile institutions. Cohen disarms his targets by displaying bigotry, intolerance and straight-up stupidity. By believing <em>they </em>are the smartest person in the room, Cohen’s targets are lulled into a sense of security, and frequently respond with shocking levels of these same traits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Borat 2 </em>really outshines its predecessor with the scope and ambition of Cohen’s selected targets. This would not have been possible without the equally outrageous Maria Bakalova, who plays Borat’s 15-year-old daughter, Tutar. Both are expert provocateurs but, being female, Bakalova exposes the kind of blatant sexism and sickening creepiness in a way that Cohen could never have achieved on his own.&nbsp; When discussing a proposed breast enlargement, for example, Bakalova naively asks the consultant if he would “make sexy talk with her&#8221; to which he responds: “If your father wasn’t here, yes.” Moreover, at a pro-life clinic, she exposes the inhumanity of anti-abortion practice when a practicing doctor tells her that “God doesn’t make mistakes”, despite believing that she was underage, pregnant and had been raped by her father.&nbsp; Finally, after an interview with Donald Trump’s personal attorney and former New York Mayor, Rudy Giuliani, Bakalova highlights the predatory instinct prevalent in so many high-profile men, as Giuliani proceeds to grope her and touch himself, after escorting her into his hotel bedroom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s easier to laugh when those being mocked represent the problem – racists, homophobes, misogynists and the like – but what about Cohen’s innocent casualties? The scenes in “Kazakhstan”, for example, present an entire nation as an obscenely primitive, backwards hovel. These scenes were actually filmed in Glod, a Roma village in Romania. The villagers seen in the film are real residents of Glod, who later took legal action against the film as they claim they were recruited under false pretences. One Roma community leader alleged they were told it was a documentary, not a comedy. Cohen’s goal is to satirise Americans’ ignorance of other cultures, so <em>Borat</em>’s “Kazakhstan” representswhat Americans supposedly <em>believe </em>countrieslike Kazakhstan are like. But is it ethical to absolve Cohen’s offense simply because of his underlying intentions? Afterall, Cohen is first and foremost a comedian, and at times it appears that his thirst for laughs outweighs his more noble political agenda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, when presented with the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymaWq5yZIYM\" target=\"_blank\">ADL’s International Leadership Award</a>, Cohen acknowledged this conflict within his work: “I’m not going to claim that everything I’ve done is for a higher purpose&#8230;half my comedy is absolutely juvenile&#8230;the other half, completely puerile.” It’s regrettable that Cohen’s conflicting agendas run the risk of discrediting his work’s political ambitions for the sake of a few juvenile chuckles. Jeanise Jones, a social worker who is left to look after Tutar whilst Borat is away, stands out as another unnecessary target in <em>Borat 2. </em>Jeanise genuinely believes that Tutar is being subjected to an oppressive and dangerous regime by her father, and Jeanise is clearly distressed by the ordeal. Additionally, Borat’s final words to Jeanise (“Will you be my new black wife?”) seem to lack purpose, other than an attempt at a cheap gag. Equally, when Cohen (in an extremely uncomfortable scene) enters an open synagogue, and approaches a Holocaust survivor, whilst he is dressed in a crude arrangement of anti-semitic symbols, the targets really believe that their safe place of worship is being threatened.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;If Cohen’s objective in weaponising comedy is to expose hypocrisy, racism and bigotry, then why subject innocent people to it too?&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can any of Cohen’s innocent victims’ experiences align with the intentions of this unique brand of activism? If Cohen’s objective in weaponising comedy is to expose hypocrisy, racism and bigotry, then why subject innocent people to it too? Unexpectedly, there may still be some value here. Once again, Cohen is not asking us to look at his character but rather the reaction of those around him. Jeanise privately reminds Tutar that her father (Borat) is not telling her the truth and, furthermore, tolerates his behaviour with dignity, so that she can advise him on his wrong doings, in the hopes it will give Tutar a better life. Similarly, the Jewish ladies in the synagogue show remarkable empathy, despite Borat’s unrelenting bigotry, when they sit him down, give him food and listen to his ‘story’. Borat is still acting as a honeypot. Just as his nasty characteristics are often mirrored by others, with a special few it reveals the immense kindness, forgiveness and humanity that people are capable of showing, no matter how trying the circumstances. With such severe examples of antisemitism, there’s no doubt some viewers will still be deeply offended by this scene, no matter what his intentions are. To me, however, the moment where Cohen is sat face to face with an elderly Holocaust survivor, dressed as a proud anti-Semite, and met with nothing but love was extremely touching. The ethics behind Cohen taking this risk with unsuspecting people are undoubtedly questionable, but the footage is a showcase of both the best and the worst of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the audience is aware of Cohen’s intentions, it is easier to be more forgiving of some of Borat&#8217;s behaviour, but the worry is that many viewers will take the material at face value and misuse the abundance of offensive soundbites in ways that completely contradict the film’s purpose. I would like to believe, however, that films <em>do </em>have the power to enact change and, though Cohen’s character is not perfect, I admire how he has weaponised comedy to deliver powerful political blows, using some of the most high-profile culprits as puppets in their own demise. In <em>Borat 2, </em>Cohen ridicules some of society’s highest echelons. The question is: will it be enough? In a time where the world has grown accustomed to a clown in the presidency, does poking fun at those in power still have the impact it once did? Only time will tell, but Cohen’s weapon has earned its place in activism&#8217;s arsenal, directed at those who believe their ugly truths are above being exposed. Cohen’s character attracts and exposes what is patently wrong and in doing so, reminds us to do what is right: fight against bigots, no matter how loud they shout.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Alex Urquhart</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Comment your thoughts and rate this article below!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/alexurquhart/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5f9cb7e92243a85d728e7635827748a5?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Alex Urquhart\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/alexurquhart/\">Alex Urquhart</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I’ve always known we live in a phallocentric world- I’d seen and drawn about a thousand penises before I ever took a good look at my own ladyparts. If I said to draw a cis-woman’s nether regions, most people wouldn’t even know where to start. And, if they did get anywhere, I can guarantee they’d draw a vulva (the part that’s visible) and shout something like ‘See! Vagina!’. Not a vagina. Vulva.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s face it, cis-women’s bodies are a complicated, wild, terrifying and uniquely fascinating topic. Our boobs grow then make food, we go through menstruation, menopause- and oh let’s not forget that we literally bring life into this world! It seems bizarre to me that everyone, worldwide, isn’t made to learn about the female body in immense detail- if not in the name of edification, then in the name of sustainability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But alas. Around the world, women’s health is treated, for the most part, as literally some kind of joke. While men’s health is taken about as seriously as money.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Healthcare and medicine has, more often than not, been dominated by and centred on cis-men. And if you think it’s not affecting women just about everywhere, keep reading. Here are just 3 examples of the ways in which women’s health is, indeed, a global shitshow:</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-left\"><strong>Period Poverty</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If the fact that we bleed from our vaginas isn’t enough of a bummer, let’s take a second just to consider the costs associated. Those of us who can afford pads, tampons or even contemporary products such as moon cups, often take for granted just how lucky we are. When people can’t access sanitary products or information about menstruation due to financial constraints, it’s called Period Poverty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A survey conducted by Plan International UK (of 1,000 young women aged 14-21) showed that in the UK alone, about 1 in 10 girls can’t afford menstrual products, and 1 in 7 struggle to afford them. Yep, that’s in the UK alone. I won’t even get started on the statistics for other, less economically developed countries. But I’ll tell you this: it’s bloody devastating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The impacts of this poverty go far beyond the obvious ‘destroying all my pants’ and ‘making me feel sticky and gross’. It can cause health issues like UTIs and reproductive infections. Girls are missing school, facing disastrous impacts on their education and future. Oh, and a little thing called MENTAL HEALTH! Just imagine the stress, anxiety, depression, and embarrassment of not being able to (literally or mentally) soak up something we have absolutely no control over.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Harmful Practices and Malpractice</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>All over the world, women’s bodies are being mutilated against their will. Not a fun sentence to read, and not an uplifting topic to discuss, but frankly I couldn’t care less.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven’t heard about FGM (Female Genital Mutilation, sometimes known as female circumcision), here’s a quick summary: female genitals (usually with a focus on the clitoris) are removed or damaged, with hopes of reducing a woman’s sexual pleasure and desire. It’s usually carried out on religious or cultural grounds, preferably preserving the woman’s virginity for longer. The horrendous act is typically performed before puberty, sometimes on baby girls as young as one day old, usually without any anaesthetic. Sharp objects are used, which are rarely disinfected. These include knives, scissors, razors and pieces of broken glass.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sounds too horrific to be real, or at least too depraved to be common. Yet, every single year, 3 million girls are at risk of FGM. It’s most common in Africa, but also takes place in the Middle East, South Asia – even immigrants in Europe. The World Health Organisation reckon 200 million women are affected by FGM worldwide, with 1 million in Europe alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even in the USA, where such cultural practices are uncommon, women’s bodies are not safe from mutilation. Just this year, the “primary gynaecologist” at an ICE detention centre in Georgia was caught out for performing unnecessary hysterectomies on several women, claiming they had dangerous cysts (when they really didn’t). In fact, some of these women had absolutely no concerns about their reproductive health, and most were completely dumfounded to find that they would be undergoing surgery the same day!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why, might you ask, is this happening? It might be something to do with the fact that independent doctors, like Dr. Amin, are paid for the procedures they perform by the Department of Homeland Security. The procedures performed by Dr. Amin are typically billed at thousands of dollars each.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just think. These women, many of whom speak little English, wake up from the anaesthetic and ask ‘“Why’d I have this surgery?”. But, by that point, it’s too late. And they can say goodbye to any dreams they may have once had of bearing children. Gone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Pro-Life, Pro-Housewife</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, I think we all know how people can get about the A word…&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abortion. The word is abortion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a whole kerfuffle about it at the moment in Rome, Italy. Women’s aborted foetuses are somehow being acquired by Catholic groups and buried at cemeteries, with the mother’s names on the tombstone. Yep, I’m serious. Women are literally rocking up to their loved ones’ funerals, only to stumble across what look like their own graves. Spooky, and messed up. It’s damn hard to get an abortion in Rome, with few hospitals providing the service and most healthcare professionals living on some sort of fabricated moral high ground. My question is, how are these Catholic groups getting hold of the foetuses, when hospitals require the mother’s permission for burials?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re wondering why I, and most women I know, are Pro-Choice, let me put it this way: pregnancy and motherhood are not easy. It’s not like taking up badminton or getting a tattoo. It’s time-consuming, world-changing, and sometimes agonising work. And if you’re not ready, or think you never will be, then you should have a choice- end of. Those who believe otherwise, evidently also believe that it’s a woman’s ethical duty to have children. And that assuming the role of a mother is far more important than their own personal fulfilment or joy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, I’m going to be bold and say that Pro-life is not so different from pro-housewife. Pro-female-oppression. Pro-shitshow-healthcare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>And that’s just scratching the surface…</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news about all this, is that you can do something. Men, you can fight our corner and learn about our bodies. Stop being afraid! They’re not gross, they’re incredible. Women; we can insist on healthcare equality, and we can encourage our friends and families to talk openly about female reproductive issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take away the stigma, take away the embarrassment, and bring in empowerment. It’s the only way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information on period poverty, take a look at these:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/period-poverty-everything-you-need-to-know/\">https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/period-poverty-everything-you-need-to-know/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.actionaid.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/womens-economic-empowerment/period-poverty\">https://www.actionaid.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/womens-economic-empowerment/period-poverty</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloodygoodperiod.com/\">https://www.bloodygoodperiod.com/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More info on FGM:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.desertflowerfoundation.org/en/what-is-fgm.html\">https://www.desertflowerfoundation.org/en/what-is-fgm.html</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://plan-uk.org/blogs/why-does-fgm-happen\">https://plan-uk.org/blogs/why-does-fgm-happen</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/zaraazam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">By Zara Azam</a></em></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/zaraazam/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/19698cc8c8789f20fdfd3bdf6212aa9d?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Zara Azam\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/zaraazam/\">Zara Azam</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

The fence is an ‘eruv’, a symbolic extension of the home for practicing Jews, marking out the domain where they are allowed to carry essential items on the Sabbath. Yet an eruv also acts as an enclosure, and for Orthodox Jews to step outside of this parameter is a violation of the holy day. It thus seems no coincidence that the broken eruv in the opening scene of ‘Unorthodox’ foreshadows Esty’s escape from her Hasidic Jewish community in Williamsburg, New York. The figurative walls have enclosed her so far, and the gap in the eruv becomes an opportune symbol for her escape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-unorthodox-sequel-book-could-be-adapted-for-a-second-season-1586955835.jpg?resize=640%2C360&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2119\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-unorthodox-sequel-book-could-be-adapted-for-a-second-season-1586955835.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-unorthodox-sequel-book-could-be-adapted-for-a-second-season-1586955835.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-unorthodox-sequel-book-could-be-adapted-for-a-second-season-1586955835.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspired by Deborah Feldman’s 2012 autobiography, ‘Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots’, the 4-part Netflix series charts the heroine Esty’s flight from life in an oppressive Orthodox Jewish community in Williamsburg to her arrival and following adventures in secular Berlin. Magnificently played by Israeli actress Shira Haas, we are guided through Esty’s repatriation to Berlin as she steps into the very location of her community’s past trauma. Getting a taxi from the airport, possessionless and frightened, Esty’s tear-filled eyes gaze out of the window and land on the the Victory Column. A monument to German militarism, allusions to Germany’s Nazi past are abundant in the series and this then sheds light on the complex situation we find our protagonist in: A Jewish woman seeking liberation in a city where such liberation has historically been vehemently denied. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet the series also presents Berlin as progressive. It is a melting pot of different races and cultures, where individualism takes precedence over any sense of community. The expansive space of the Wannsee lake, where Esty visits with her new music college friends, presents a stark contrast to the dim and claustrophobic apartments of her past in Williamsburg. As her friends strip off and run into the waters in their bikinis, Esty watches with a mix of incredulity and curiosity. After a few moments of reflection, she removes her flesh-coloured tights and tentatively wades into the waters almost fully clothed. In perhaps the series’ most powerful scene, Esty peels off her sheitel, a wig worn by Orthodox married Jewish women, and drops it into the water to drift away. Her shaven head bared, we witness the process of Esty physically shedding her Orthodox past, her sheitel having constituted an identity that was constructed for her rather than it being her own. The Wannsee waters perform a kind of cleansing for Esty: a purging of her past life and the beginning of her journey towards self-discovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Directed by Maria Schrader and written by Anna Winger, Alexa Karolinski and Daniel Hendler, ‘Unorthodox’ turns into a coming of age story as Esty searches to find her identity, which has until now been suppressed by her unyielding past. The narrative is interwoven with flashbacks to scenes performed in Yiddish, revealing the lead up and subsequent decay of Esty in her unhappy arranged marriage to fellow Orthodox Jew Yanky Shapiro (Amit Rahav). In the present, Yanky, accompanied by his extremely unpleasant cousin Moishe Lefkovitch (Jeff Wilbusch) chase Esty down, the urgency heightened by the belief that she is pregnant with Yanky’s child.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one of the final scenes, Esty auditions for a scholarship at a prestigious music school in Berlin. Unable to sing in her Satmar community because it is considered immodest, Esty performs ‘Mi Bon Siach’,&nbsp; a Hebrew song traditionally sung at Jewish weddings by the male family members. This very song was chorused at Esty and Yanky’s wedding, while Esty was quite literally being led blind to the chuppah before the official ceremony (a bride’s face is veiled by a badeken in a traditional Jewish marriage ceremony). By performing this song, Esty is rewriting her past of subjugation and transforming it into her own empowerment. She is reclaiming back her voice, a voice that had been suppressed in her marriage by expectations in her community that a women’s role is to procreate and seemingly achieve little more. Shira Haas’ performance here is breathtaking, and Esty’s suffering is vigorously felt by those watching both on and off the screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>’Unorthodox’ is therefore an incredibly moving series, and from when we first lay eyes on our heroine we can’t help but be completely invested in Esty’s quest for liberation from her haunting past life. It is both a joy and a privilege to be witness to such a journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Lara Keville</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Comment your thoughts and rate this article below!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/larakeville/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76bbebf22b4349a8a5bf356f09eb45b5?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Lara Keville\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/larakeville/\">Lara Keville</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Rather than speculate over the result of the election and potential determining factors, this article aims to shed some light on one of the groups Trump will be relying on for his re-election: America’s vast number of Evangelical Christians. This contingent of Christianity accounts for over 60 million citizens, according to a recent Financial Times article, some 18% of the population. Whilst this sect is not statistically the most loyal political agent of the religious world (that accolade going to the Mormons), the sheer size of this following is what gives it political power.&nbsp;In the last election, 81% of evangelists voted for Trump, and recent polls have suggested that November will see an increase in this figure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the rest of the Western world, America is disproportionately devout, with Ireland the only nation to ‘out-believe’ in God. For a politician to publicly declare themselves an atheist is to commit career suicide, as they will be dumped by the electorate as an immoral candidate. A 2019 Gallup poll concluded that the only thing less appealing to American voters than an atheist is a socialist. Christians are disproportionately represented by 88.2% of Congress, despite 70% of the public identifying as Christian.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, why do so many of the evangelical movement back Trump? Well, there has been an ongoing relationship between the religious right and the GOP since the 1980 election, when abortion became a political issue in the aftermath of Roe v. Wade. The 1973 Supreme Court decision roused religious institutions into political action, after a realisation of the vast amount of influence they could exert over politics by playing the numbers game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Trump and Pence they saw two people who would protect them and shared their world view. Their feeling of being oppressed cannot be underestimated, despite the seeming lunacy of these emotions. A 2017 report by the Public Religion Research Institute discovered that white Evangelicals believe they are more discriminated against than are Muslims in the USA, demonstrating the extreme and unfounded sentiments that influence their political persuasions. Trump has played these emotions by encouraging them to view themselves as a targeted group, at risk of losing their way of life to liberalism. Whilst this tactic may seem to work, depending on the levels of one’s cynicism, it is a method of fearmongering where Trump is simultaneously heightening the threat perception of conservative Christians and offering them a solution in himself. The irony of Trump’s masquerading as a moral saviour cannot be missed.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Time and time again, faith leaders have dismissed and excused Trump’s behaviour when so few others have been able to&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why are Trump’s vast swaths of controversies not enough to dissuade so many Evangelicals to vote for him? How can a man who is guilty of narcissism, sexism, bullying and allegedly paying off a porn-star over an affair really be the “dream president” that popular televangelist, Jerry Falwell Jr, touts him to be? The hierarchical structure of religious organisations is mostly responsible for this, where popular preachers and pastors are able to generate reliable, and even predictable, responses from their followers due to the high level of trust communities place in church leaders. Time and time again, faith leaders have dismissed and excused Trump’s behaviour when so few others have been able to. In exchange for pardoning Trump’s behaviour, these leaders have been rewarded with invitations into the White House, positions in the Trump administration and policies that reinforce conservativism in the States.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The strength of Church influence over peoples’ political view is clearly exemplified in the Latino community. Prof. Matthew Wilson of Southern Baptist University Dallas, who specialises in religious influence over political behaviour, has emphasised the significance of religion in maintaining support for Trump within the Latino community. Despite multiple instances of policy discrimination against Latino migrants, notably the splitting up of children from parents at the US-Mexico border – which was condemned as a form of mental torture by the Physicians for Human Rights group – and labelling Mexican immigrants as “bad hombres”, “criminals” and “drug dealers”, the President enjoys continued support from this group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout Trump’s first term, there has been a consistent 30% of this demographic maintaining support for Trump. This is remarkable due to the demonisation and othering inflicted upon them by Trump, who claims America is facing an “invasion” through its southern border. What is interesting about this case study is that the 30% who have remained loyal to Trump are those that identify as Evangelical Christians. It is evident that these votes are being captured by the GOP as a result of their stance as the conservative, God-fearing party. The Democrats, however, in the eyes of the Evangelical community, threaten the values held most highly with their discourse of progressiveness and liberalism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not to say that being an Evangelical is synonymous with being a Trump supporter. There are of course some in the community who have called Trump out for being the abhorrent, self-obsessed pariah that his actions have certainly sketched him as. Those who have disavowed Trump as a champion of their faith have been as reviled by his actions as anyone, and where their political views are concerned, they don’t tend to identify as single-issue voters – that is, their vote will not be decided on a candidate’s stance on one issue (we’re talking about abortion again here). </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Evangelical critics of Trump have faced severe backlash from other leaders in their community after going public with their concerns. Mark Galli was the former editor of Christianity Today (CT), a flagship magazine of Evangelism founded by Billy Graham, one of the ‘fathers’ of the politicisation of religion in the 1980 election. During the impeachment proceedings last year, Galli penned an editorial in which he called for Trump’s removal from office and criticised his leadership. This article was condemned by Trump on Twitter, who dismissed Galli’s criticism as “far left… or very ‘progressive’, as some would call it.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the aftermath of the article, Galli found the board of CT becoming increasingly hostile and felt more and more unwelcome at the magazine. Two months later he had been fired as the company tried to distance themselves from his words. Clearly, the Evangelical atmosphere is not receptive to any member who drifts from the position the group projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2020 election is just around the corner, and the result has far greater ramifications than at first glance. For example, if Trump is voted in for a second term, it is a decisive victory for populism and would likely give more traction to the rising tide of populism seen in Europe at present. This is an era of great change in politics. As division in society is exacerbated by leaders of movements, this has injured the ability for adversaries to debate in an honest way, as seen in the unprofessional and embarrassing first presidential debate. All that is left to do now is to wait with bated breath and chew one’s nails.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/louismartin/\" target=\"_blank\">Louis Martin</a> </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Comment your thoughts and rate this article below!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/louismartin/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a57d64ef695ef683dc93f333d9abe4a8?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Louis Martin\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/louismartin/\">Louis Martin</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Her Instagram boasts 2,8 million followers, she has almost 700,000 monthly listeners on Spotify, she counts Prada and Chanel among her clients and Millie Bobby Brown to her best friends. She seems to have it all. The only thing she lacks is a body and a mind of her own, since she is not actually real.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years, Instagram, and social media generally, has witnessed the birth of a new type of influencer – one whose entire being is, unbeknownst to their human followers, created and controlled by individuals hidden in the shadows of the internet, who quietly pull the strings behind-the-scenes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Already this type of influencer is more common than people may realise. A recent <a href=\"https://fullscreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Fullscreen_CGI-Influencers_Bot-Or-Not.pdf\">study by Fullscreen</a> shows that a staggering 42% of Gen Z and Millennials have followed an influencer on social media that they didn’t know was only an avatar. It is unsurprising, really, that virtual influencers blend so seamlessly into our feeds, since Instagram is crawling with fake looking real women who, with the help of Apps like Facetune, can easily make themselves look more CGI than human. “I like to think of myself as being as real as anything else on social media. Is Kylie [Jenner] ‘real’?”, Miquela said in an <a href=\"https://www.ladygunn.com/music/miquela-interview/\">interview with Ladygun</a>. She continued, “We live in a world where a good majority of the things we see have been polished, pinched, reframed, recropped, recontextualized. I think real is whatever you believe in”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Miquela, the OG-virtual influencer, is the brainchild of Trevor McFedries and Sara DeCou, co-founders of Brud, an LA-based tech start-up focusing on robotics, artificial intelligence and their applications to media businesses. Their bizarre “website” is nothing more than an open access, one-page Google Doc, on which Brud is cryptically described as “a transmedia studio that creates digital character driven story worlds, (that) have the power to introduce marginalized ideas wrapped in the familiarity of entertainment”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their novel approach to storytelling turns out to be a lucrative business. In 2018, Brud secured a $6 million in venture capital funding in response to its success with Lil Miquela on her various social media and music streaming platforms and is now said to be worth over $125 million in total.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Miquela started out as a digital project on Instagram in 2016. For two years she let her loyal followers, her “Miquelians”, believe she was a real person, until she was “hacked” by Bermuda, a bot created by Cain Intelligence, as part of a masterfully executed meta PR stunt. Bermuda, a Trump supporter and self-proclaimed “robot supremacist”, accused Miquela of being a “fake ass person” and demanded she tell her followers “the truth” about who she really was. What followed was a full-blown robot meltdown, culminating in her stating the obvious – “Guys, I’m not a human being”. Bizarrely, her followers met her with genuine sympathy. “You’re real to me” one said in the comments, “I’ll support you all the way” adds another. Her following exploded since then and is continuing to grow steadily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Miquela muses on her success in <a href=\"https://www.ladygunn.com/music/miquela-interview/\">an interview</a>, saying, “At its core, the digital space is about connection. Younger generations seem way more open to the idea of virtual artists and influencers because they’ve been forming these deep connections with people over the Internet their entire lives. They’re less sceptical about suspending belief and engaging with us and our stories”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, when real human influencers are asked what their key to success is, they consistently emphasise the importance of authenticity and “keeping it real”. At the same time, it seems that Miquela’s blatant inauthenticity is integral to her appeal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“She is an Insta-cyborg of ethnically ambiguous, woke, idealised, young womanhood, a puppet whose strings are pulled to respond to the demands of the market, creating maximum appeal and profit”, Pandora Sykes writes in her essay “The Authentic Lie”. By definition Miquela cannot be authentic, for she is not an autonomic being.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Authenticity in the digital age is problematic, since it calls for “an impossible consistency no human can provide”, Sykes argues. Nowadays an influencer’s every word and every move are monitored, captured and discussed online at rapid fire pace. As humans they are bound to slip up at some point, and until this happens, the public patiently lies in waiting, salivating at the thought of impeding drama. And then &#8211; breaking news &#8211; a supposedly “ultra-sustainable” influencer is caught in a brand deal with Amazon, a vegan influencer is caught sipping a cow milk cappuccino and a “body positive” influencer is caught buying shapewear. All hell breaks loose: Twitter explodes and malicious memes flood Instagram as bored bloggers are overwrought by the unexpected gossipy fodder, while their loyal followers feel betrayed (“I can’t believe this, I thought you were <em>authentic</em>!”). With cancel culture firmly established, such a simple “mistake” can cost an influencer their career or at least profoundly harm it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Miquela, on the other hand, with her impeccably coded manners would never mess up her brand like that. She is programmed for consistency and maximum relatability. Frank Mulhern, Northwestern University professor of integrated marketing communications is convinced that this gives CGI influencers a key advantage over their human competitors. In an <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/life/2019/10/16/cgi-influencers-blur-line-between-reality-and-fantasy-instagram-advertising/3790471002/\">interview with USA Today</a> he says robots and virtual characters aren’t affected by human error and thus will never get caught in a scandal. “They can be programmed to say things and do things in online environments in ways that the brand marketers want them to”, he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is true, to an extent. However, what Mulhern seems to forget is that, Miquela and her emerging posse of CGI influencers aren’t fully AI powered (yet), meaning the content they put out on the internet is still, somewhere, controlled by a human. She is currently nothing more than a middle-man – or rather – a pretty face for someone else’s (Brud’s) opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fallibility of even fake robo influencers was made painfully apparent in a tone-deaf video, in which Miquela recounts her experience of being sexually harassed by a Lyft driver. A shit storm ensued as people were, understandably, irritated that a fake avatar was trying to use real women’s traumatic experiences to her own benefit in order to increase follower trust and engagement. She had previously garnered similar critique for her alleged struggles with depression – and that’s not all. Her 2019 brand deal with Calvin Klein, in which she is pictured kissing heterosexual supermodel Bella Hadid was torn apart for “queerbaiting” and for depicting queerness as “surreal”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;The stats speak for themselves&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the backlash – Miquela and her CGI pals remain profitable. People continue to engage with their content, be it out of mere curiosity, it doesn’t really matter. The stats speak for themselves. Fullscreen report that, of the followers of CGI influencers, 55% were led to make a purchase or attend an event, 53% started following an endorsed brand, 52% were motivated to research a brand or product via affiliate links. Whether we like it or not, virtual influencers are changing the landscape of digital marketing – and they aren’t likely to be disappearing any time soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is easy to see why brands may be tempted to shift their focus on virtual influencers in the future. They are much easier and cheaper to work with than a real person. Think about it, they will never throw a diva-style hissy fit, will never turn up to a photo shoot hungover, with a face full of acne, in a bad mood or sick. In fact, a they will never show up at all. Plus, there is no need to spend a fortune on make-up artists, hair stylists, transportation or hotels – the virtual influencer needs nothing more than a system update once in a while and a power connection. Plus, conveniently, no real-life event, like a global pandemic, affects their availability in any way. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, will robo influencers like Miquela slowly overtake their human peers, brainwash young impressionable children and teens, take control over social media and eventually achieve world domination? Who knows! Maybe one day. However, as of right now “Project Virtual Influencer” is still in its infancy. They are not anywhere near becoming self-controlled sentient beings operating on their own terms – which is the underlying fear of many. Nonetheless, with their growing number and advancing technical sophistication, full transparency regarding who controls a virtual influencer’s content will become more important than ever, in order to remain moral and ethical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bottom line is, the whole world of influencers is really about marketing, which has been around for a long time. As long as people are aware of the ways in which they may be deceived, they will be able to retain a critical perspective of their feeds, and humans and robots will be able to co-exist peacefully – I hope.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/clarameyer-horn/\" target=\"_blank\">By Clara Meyer-Horn</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Comment your thoughts and rate this article below!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/clarameyer-horn/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7d17b45d6fe92d69245e50d8085e524e?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Clara Meyer-Horn\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/clarameyer-horn/\">Clara Meyer-Horn</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

He asks you to pull up your dress to prove to him that you are wearing underwear. You then continue your journey. As you are putting your key in your front door, another police officer approaches you on your doorstep. He asks you how you got the money to buy the car sitting on your drive. He accuses you of being a prostitute. If it sounds like this could only be an excerpt from a dystopian novel, you would be mistaken. This is happening right now, in Nigeria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Created in 1992, the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) is a unit of the Nigerian police force. Its original objective was to stamp out violent crime. Since its inception, however, SARS has been widely accused of human rights violations. Initially, SARS officers were not required to wear a uniform, making them a faceless entity of law enforcement. Their increasingly visible presence in Nigerian society has led to wide-scale corruption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>First-hand accounts of SARS brutality suggest officers are targeting young Nigerian men and women, questioning their acquisition of wealth. These suspicions are allegedly dealt with extrajudicial punishment, ranging from physical violence and torture, to extortion and robbery. Other accounts suggest routine interrogation and harassment. In a twist of painful irony, SARS has become the embodiment of the behaviour it aimed to address.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many have taken to Twitter to share their experience of SARS brutality, starting the #EndSARS movement. At the beginning of October, footage emerged of SARS officers dragging two men out of a hotel in Lagos. Neither men appear to be resisting, and yet a police officer drags one of the men&#8217;s bodies out into the street and shoots him. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent weeks, the issue reached a climax with protests breaking out across the country. Peaceful protestors in Lagos and Abuja have been subject to shooting and teargassing by the police. At least ten protestors are said to have been killed. News footage shows the anguish of protestors:  ‘Stop killing our boyfriends, stop killing our children. Stop. Mothers are crying’, a woman cries from an open car window. ‘I am tired’, another protestor screams into a news camera lens, ‘I am tired’.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"595\" height=\"474\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture-1.jpg?resize=595%2C474&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2087\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture-1.jpg?w=595&amp;ssl=1 595w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture-1.jpg?resize=300%2C239&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>President Muhammadu Buhari has recently acknowledged the extrajudicial killings and wrongful conduct of the SARS unit. He made a statement that the unit will be ‘dissolved with immediate effect’. Buhari continues by stating that:</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>‘The disbandment of SARS is only the first step in our commitment to extensive police reform, in order to ensure that the primary duty of the police and other law enforcement agencies remains the protection of lives and livelihoods of our people.’</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Although this may give new hope, Buhari’s announcement has been met with both joy and contempt. The disbandment of SARS states the deployment of officers to other police units. Such a measure does not ensure the complete dissolution of police brutality, sparking frustration at the lack of accountability for the abuse suffered at the hands of SARS. Osai Ojigho – Nigeria’s director of Amnesty International – released a responsive statement:</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>‘The police authorities must state strongly the concrete steps they will take to ensure all officers alleged to have committed human rights violations are investigated and brought to justice.’</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not the first time anti-SARS protests have erupted. In 2017, Nigerian celebrities shared their experiences of being arrested in an effort to end SARS altogether. Nigeria’s chief of police Adamu Mohammed consequently re-organised SARS, yet as recent events have proven, reform has not quashed brutality. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The young people of Nigeria don’t want reform. They want the complete and absolute dissolution of not only SARS but police corruption. The protests have proven that there is significant disharmony between the Nigerian people and their judicial system. While SARS may be at the forefront, the mismanagement of policing culture remains the underlying source of contention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Celebrities like John Boyega, Maya Jama, and Estelle have used their social media platforms to encourage their followers to speak out against SARS.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The youth in Nigeria deserve good leadership and guidance.

We are still living in an age of catastrophic injustice and, tragically, many of these issues slip beneath our critical attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there is a possibility of change. In the wake of George Floyd&#8217;s murder, outrage crescendoed across the world at police brutality and systemic racism. Although greater reform is desperately needed, the Black Lives Matter movement has already prompted action. From the disbandment of the Minneapolis police department to the removal of the Colston statue, 2020 has shown young people that using our voices <em>can </em>instigate change. To continue the fight, we need to keep the momentum going, and spreading awareness is the first step in causing global outrage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what can we do here in the United Kingdom? Well, education is the first step. Below is a comprehensive guide on the issue of SARS, as well as spaces to donate and volunteer. The guide also suggests social media accounts to follow to keep up to date on the issue.

Whether it be food wasted, cheap clothing bought only to be worn once or buying single-use plastic as some think it easier to buy a water bottle everyday than carrying their own, we have become a society brainwashed by consumerism. This is accompanied by a disregard for the environment. It is estimated that in the UK around seven million tonnes of food is wasted everyday (WRAP); three out of five fast fashion items end up in a landfill (Clean Clothes Campaign) and over one-hundred and fifty plastic bottles litter every mile of UK beaches (SAS). Even though, as standalone acts, these behaviours may seem minor, individual action is incredibly important. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes we urgently need systemic change but the little changes which can be made to everyday life can have impressive impacts on the wider climate crisis—and think how far we could come if everybody made those small changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let’s set the scene. It’s a Tuesday evening, sports night is just twenty-four hours away and once again you have nothing to wear—this week’s theme is ‘Jungle’. Of course the first solution that comes to mind is Amazon prime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT have you ever considered how wasteful and resource intensive Amazon Prime really is? Think about it: you order a set of leopard ears and a tail which arrive in plastic packaging, in the most enormous box full to the brim with plastic advertisements. In addition, your idea is not revolutionary and probably 90% of sports night goers are doing exactly the same thing. Therefore delivering all of these costumes in such a short amount of time is going to lead to a higher number of delivery trucks on the roads, creating more congestion and even higher levels of carbon emissions—not to mention the excess of plastic packaging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How can we overcome this issue and try to make student living more sustainable?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer: HAZAAR!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WhatsApp-Image-2020-10-22-at-10.50.05.jpg?resize=640%2C146&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2083\" width=\"640\" height=\"146\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WhatsApp-Image-2020-10-22-at-10.50.05.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=854%2C195&amp;ssl=1 1708w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WhatsApp-Image-2020-10-22-at-10.50.05.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=854%2C195&amp;ssl=1 2562w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Hazaar is a new zero waste student marketplace designed specifically to enable students to become more environmentally friendly and reduce their carbon footprint. Most of the time the item you’re after is lying under the bed of someone who lives two doors down from you, as such there is no justification for the excessive plastic packaging and travel miles which comes with one-click shopping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hazaar simply acts as the middle-man in this situation meaning shopping can be done online within the individual’s university jurisdiction and the goods can simply be handed over in person. Anything can be bought on Hazaar, whether fancy dress; textbooks; household paraphernalia — the opportunities are limitless!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hazaar was founded by University of Birmingham student, Harriet Noy (21), following the success of her society ‘Plastic-free UOB’ which she had co-founded in September 2019. The society aimed to reduce single-use plastic on campus which led her to notice the issue of waste within student trading habits and thus Hazaar was born. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After gaining investment during lockdown in March Hazaar’s app development is currently underway and is expected to be released shortly after Christmas. In the meantime, there have been Facebook marketplaces set up for thirty-seven different universities across the UK with over ten and a half thousand members in total. Each Facebook marketplace has its own Head of Hazaar to help organise trading at each university and is a great indication of how the business will continue to grow in the coming future. Here is a snapshot of some of the universities Hazaar is at!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/nSvLsvyPi5UepBWQuqLnj_ZyVzmVoVvAaCMOSyfJXlqrONhOth2Z1yqlUaJePy9rpn-s1QR4xlG2t4A5STCEquUEo0tQJcqAIbLsW9ZNF6mtCH07TL0t0nUXpBAizq9eJkEJn83V\" alt=\"\" width=\"398\" height=\"394\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding sustainable alternatives which remain convenient for students to go about their daily lives is an ever-increasing challenge. Yet given the severity of the current climate crisis and the limited response from our authorities, it is a challenge which Noy and her team are eager to take on board and determined to support to the fullest extent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst Hazaar is primarily a zero waste marketplace, the company wishes to spread the message of sustainability within all aspects of life to help students lead a greener, more environmentally conscious existence. Across all of Hazaar’s social media platforms are regular posts which share useful facts and tips regarding sustainability. Recent posts include charity shopping tips and hard facts about fast fashion, as well as sharing insightful and entertaining podcasts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hazaar’s aim is to create awareness of how habitual student practices are harming the environment and to provide simple solutions to overcome this. Other features of Hazaar’s social media include ‘Reworked Wednesday’ and ‘Fix up Fridays’ which focus on the environmentally friendly trend of ‘upcycling’. These posts demonstrate how to go about turning the old into the new and showcase some of the people who are doing a great job of it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZaDxXx_aoPhNweNxeCGUq9UwCYhcsfKAIzIIxeY8m38tqlhtKYwgTk24BdTvdZ9XSAaGEBijfUbnRGiC_PRGBDzZb4hq3IEApA2EMqsPjZXMGeqzQoL9TzcqlPT6aNlQpRIlcX9G\" width=\"602\" height=\"316\"></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noy has also set up a blog in which she exhibits the logistics of starting up a business. So far the blog has showcased the ongoings of the business from the inside through personal accounts from members of her team and a description of the process behind brand design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through being completely open and honest Noy hopes her blog will help inspiring entrepreneurs to take the leap of faith and pursue their ideas, as she never thought she’d reach the level of success that she has at such a young age.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To see whether or not Hazaar has reached your uni check out this link: <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/justhazaar\">https://linktr.ee/justhazaar</a>.

Never has this saying been more apt than within our modern and digitally obsessed world. Rather than living in the moment, millennials live to be “liked”, shared and posted. To our shame, endless hours are spent&nbsp;<em>curating&nbsp;</em>a picture-perfect Instagram. Individuals become re-fashioned as personal brands, utilising social media for marketing opportunities. Often morals are set aside for those all-important teeth whitening sponsorship Ads – a lucrative market. Long deleted are embarrassing photos featuring oversized sunglasses that characterised year nine. Our image forms a large part of our identity. So far, so validated. What, then, happens when we suddenly lose control of the version of ourselves we have so tirelessly created? What happens when our image ends up in the wrong, ill-intentioned hands? Suddenly, it is no longer a product we can wield ownership over.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter Emily Ratajkowski. Model, activist, actress, household name – even my dad has heard of her (the same sadly can’t be said for “Kerry Kardashian”). She starred in&nbsp;<em>iCarly</em>&nbsp;and later shot to global fame in Robin Thicke’s 2013&nbsp;<em>Blurred Lines</em>&nbsp;music video. She was named&nbsp;<em>Esquire’s</em>&nbsp;“Woman of the Year”. Aimed at the teenage boy demographic, the award is based on the genetic lottery and not philanthropic efforts or tangible achievements. Emily Ratajkowski has been on the ascent ever since.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emily’s emotive essay, “Buying Myself Back, When Does a Model own her own image?”, was published in&nbsp;<em>New York Magazine,&nbsp;</em>sparking a furore of debate. Essentially, she discusses how her image has been exploited and abused by artists, photographers, the public and her inner circle. An alarming number have, in short, profited from her social media posts and intimate photographs. She discusses how she may go about reclaiming her image.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The issues Emily raises, both consciously and inadvertently, are incredibly nuanced. They include but are not limited to emotional abuse, gaslighting, sexual assault and the unrelenting male gaze. She highlights how, as a society, we still have a long way to go in terms of progress. As a disclaimer, I am under no illusions that I will even begin to scratch the surface of such vital topics. I feel moved by her words and the vulnerability she so eloquently expresses, despite being one of the most successful models worldwide, amassing a net worth over $11.4 million. Even though I do not resonate personally with her experiences, I remain in awe of her bravery and how candidly she writes about being repeatedly exploited. Here is an internationally renowned model using her enormous platform of 26.8 million Instagram followers to provide a space for critical issues at the expense of her privacy. What a feat. What a woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Narcissus, in love with his reflection, testifies how society has long been infatuated by ideals of beauty. We are but a superficial species. Generally speaking, most of us are not highly sought-after models and do not have a captive online audience. Realistically, no one cares how many beers deep you are on a Friday afternoon, or which DJ set you live-stream. You are just not&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;interesting, in the grand scheme of things. And so, for most us, there are no real consequences of having our image plastered all over the internet. Subsequently, we often forget about the control we forfeit once we press send, post or upload.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emily Ratajkowski recognises that ‘[her] image is not [her own]’ and speaks of the disconnect she feels when confronted with it. An artist, Richard Prince, used her blown-up Instagram image as an exhibition and solely for his selfish gain. He profited from the image of Emily Ratajkowski, and yet she describes in her essay that she was expected by her boyfriend to be flattered that<em>&nbsp;she</em>&nbsp;was the chosen subject, bestowed with great honour.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Photographer Jonathan Leder also snatched the rights to her image. He leaked her polaroids, publishing a book titled&nbsp;<em>Emily Ratajkowski</em>, without her prior knowledge or consent. To avoid giving Leder undue publicity, Emily initially resisted the urge to speak out publicly. This is deeply uncomfortable. Imagine not even being able to&nbsp;<em>address&nbsp;</em>wrongdoing, for fear the perpetrator gathers momentum. Shockingly, when confronted with the sexual assault that took place, Leder stated, ironically in true man-child style, that Emily was “childish&#8230;You do know who we are talking about right? [Emily Ratajkowski] is the girl that was naked in&nbsp;<em>Treats!&nbsp;</em>magazine&#8230;You really want someone to believe she was a victim?”.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is hard even to consider his implication that nudity alone permits sexual assault. Yet, as petulant as Leder sounds, some&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;fail to see how Emily is a victim. This camp argues that&nbsp;<em>she&nbsp;</em>is the one posting photos, and&nbsp;<em>she&nbsp;</em>is the one that uses her looks to forge a successful career. Some take issue with the fact that, activism efforts aside, Emily Ratajkowski monetises the very thing she condemns: the unrelenting male gaze.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Emily recognises and utilises her sexuality as a&nbsp;<em>commodity</em>, which she employs to her advantage. There is a considerable danger in conflating her work life with her personal life. I find it unsettling that in some instances she cannot be considered a victim simply because of her stunning and lucrative looks. I would hazard a guess that dealt the same genetic hand as Ratajkowski most would seize the opportunity to capitalise it. Being extremely beautiful and successful is not enough to protect us from the perils of greedy individuals and relentless parasites. How can someone so attractive be so vulnerable? That, I believe, is what truly frightens us: even beauty cannot protect us from evil.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Link to Emily Ratajkowski’s essay: <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/emily-ratajkowski-owning-my-image-essay.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://www.thecut.com/article/emily-ratajkowski-owning-my-image-essay.html</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Lucy Summerton</em></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/lucysummerton/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e211ae2b8a4f7756ff4971bc6bec5e81?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Lucy Summerton\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/lucysummerton/\">Lucy Summerton</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

For one, they clearly have the same hair stylists (who seem to be competing over who can do the worst job).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is another similarity that is terrifying but not in a stylistic sense, their blatant disregard for the people they were elected to protect. From Trump’s joyride whilst still infectious with Covid-19, to Johnson’s fraternal protection of his friend, Dominic Cummings. Both men have chosen to bend the rules for their, or their friends&#8217;, favour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By capitalising on a pandemic, some have earnt unfathomable amounts of money whilst others have suffered physically, mentally and financially. The disparity that is present in today’s world between those making the decisions and those affected them is something I never thought I would be witness to, nor something that should occur in such a progressive and equality driven age.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we know, Trump was admitted to a very swanky hospital after contracting COVID-19 due to his initial thoughts that this was a hoax set on the world from *China*. He did not abide by the etiquette of mask-wearing and furthermore went for a drive, putting all of those around him at risk. Yet, somehow some people still admire him. But those who don’t admire him or his courageous ability to fight off the disease, those who have lost loved ones, those who are vulnerable or those that have taken the right actions are entirely within their own right to be furious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The blatant disregard for regulations shown by POTUS is horrifying. It is the most obvious of signs that those in power are able to do exactly as they please, when they please. These situations are not just present in American politics, they seem to be present in nearly every country at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst the likes of Hancock and Johnson continue to scold us for our carelessness, they and their associates continue to flounder the very same rules we are punished for “not” obeying. I am not just referring to Dominic Cummings or Margaret Ferrier, who the police recently decided not to prosecute for travelling out of London after testing positive and apparently not to have broken any laws. However, I know people who have moved around, broken lockdowns and received heavy fines. I am referring to the move that is happening in front of our eyes. A move towards authoritarianism, hidden agendas and propaganda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>MP Toby Perkins, who has experience in the sales industry, was reported to have said in an interview: “I have never come across a customer nearly as naive as … the government.” The apparent carelessness of the Conservatives at this time, who gave and continue to give large amounts of taxpayer money to corporations such as Serco or Boston Consultancy Group, shows the disconnect between politicians and people, money and health and Us and Them. If our government is fine with making bad deals with companies that are more than willing to take money and provide a below adequate service, are they really working for our benefit?  Should they really be trusted with our information and health status?</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;They profit off our suffering, whilst we suffer through endless three-word slogans with no clear direction or end in sight.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>PPE and <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/nhs-test-and-trace-if-youve-been-in-contact-with-a-person-who-has-coronavirus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Track and Trace</a> deals have hit mainstream media recently. This is important because transparency is key if Us, the people, are to trust They, the government. We are the ones affected most by this recklessness. Those in power, be it our government, or the corporations who are now responsible for the state of the nation&#8217;s health, do not care for the everyday person. They profit off our suffering, whilst we suffer through endless three-word slogans with no clear direction or end in sight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be it corporations that pump out toxic chemicals, or politicians who push rules that they themselves will not be affected by, nor will they follow. We, the people, seem to be the group that are continuously blamed and continuously suffer whilst others sit in their ivory towers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/madiapthorpe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">By Madi Apthorpe</a></em></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/madiapthorpe/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ab4fae47fb7f7a61ec381588620efeb1?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Madi Apthorpe\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/madiapthorpe/\">Madi Apthorpe</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Clutching a miniature bagel and glass of champagne, I was feeling about as bemused as the birthday girl herself when I came across Helen O’Neill. With a beatific smile and honey-hued hair, she emanated a “Who’s that girl?” glow that no one at the affair could miss. After speaking to her husband, I learnt that Helen had intellect and drive to match her breath-taking beauty. He told me that in the last year, alongside having a baby, Helen had founded Hertility Health, a company which encourages women to be proactive about their reproductive future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspiring as Helen and Hertility sounded, I was unsure what particular relevance a fertility company had to me as a 22-year-old university student. This was until Helen approached me herself and began to ask questions about my own reproductive health, such as whether I’d ever suffered from hormonal issues or side-effects relating to my menstrual cycle. I proffered a litany of grievances from a nasty contraceptive pill I’d taken when I was 15 to rotten PMS. Not surprisingly, Helen informed me that many women share similar experiences. What I was unaware of, however, was that these symptoms were not necessarily normal and should not be ignored. Helen proceeded to explain how Hertility can inform and, based on personalised testing, advise women about their hormones, enabling them to manage their reproductive issues, rather than mask them. She even offered to send me a complimentary test so that I could investigate my symptoms further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The genesis of Hertility was Helen and co-founder Natalie Getreu’s fundamental belief that monitoring a women’s reproductive health is key to her overall wellbeing. As leading experts in reproductive genetics and fertility preservation, they were frustrated by their lack of knowledge about their own reproductive health and inability to advise women outside of their own laboratories. Having successful yet demanding careers, they also battled with the question faced by many women today – whether to prioritise career aspirations over family ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are more opportunities for women than ever before, which comes with unprecedented demands and expectations that do not coincide particularly well with fertility timelines. While we may long to live in a world free from the constraints of mother nature’s “ticking time bomb”, the reality is that she isn’t quite on our side when it comes to fertility. Consequently, many women spend their 20s trying not to get pregnant and their 30s doing the opposite, meaning some only discover issues when it is already too late. It is this ubiquitous problem which sent Helen and Natalie in search of a solution. Extensive research led them to the conclusion that women need a fast and affordable method to access information about their own biology. And so Hertility was born: an at-home test which provides information not just about fertility, but reproductive health in general, empowering women to make informed decisions when it matters, not when it’s too late.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process begins with an online questionnaire in which Hertility asks personal questions such as what brought you to the test – are you concerned, suffering symptoms or simply curious? – and whether you are taking a contraceptive pill. Based on the responses, Hertility produces a test which is tailored to suit your physiology and desired outcomes and delivered directly to your door. The finger-prick blood test can then be completed from the comfort of your own home and returned using the label and packaging provided. Hertility compiles the test results into a digital report, which explains your hormone levels and how they relate to your reproductive health. It includes information about ovulation and egg count, highlighting any red flags that you may wish to prepare for in the future through, for example, egg freezing. Finally, you are given the option discuss your report with a licensed specialist who can provide further guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At £125, the Hertility test is significantly more affordable than the average clinic check-up and consultation, which can cost anywhere between £600 and £1,800. The option of cheaper private care is particularly significant for same-sex couples, who are not currently offered fertility testing by the NHS. The speed at which Hertility delivers results is another major advantage over the NHS, which can take up to a year to provide results, leading to delayed treatment and missed opportunities. The at-home aspect of the Hertility test is particularly attractive in light of Covid-19, removing the need for unnecessary travel and risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given Hertility’s founding principle that reproductive health is key to general health, testing is relevant to women beyond those interested in fertility. Every women’s menstrual cycle is unique and the experiences that come with this are often ignored, meaning women can spend years suffering without knowing that their symptoms are abnormal. GPs frequently adopt a band-aid approach to these issues by prescribing an assortment of contraceptive methods which may incur further unwanted symptoms. Hertility believes that women should understand their monthly cycle and, crucially, not be in pain. By taking one of their personalised tests, women can find the answers they deserve, bringing an end to the vicious cycle of uncertainty and discomfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hertility is a revolutionary step forward in female reproductive health. By informing women about their own biology, Hertility is empowering women to take charge of their future in a way that has never been seen before.

Masterfully directed by Lenny Abrahamson and Hettie Macdonald, its depiction of young love is so raw and painfully true to life that it seems to stir the familiar vulnerability of first love for everyone who watches. The screen-play, written by Rooney herself with Alice Birch, shows how language often fails the lovers, Marianne and Connell, in the moments they most need it. Words become suddenly inadequate when trying to communicate their emotions to one another, leading to misinterpretations and pain. These desperate scenarios leave those watching feeling incredibly frustrated as to why they can’t just say how they really feel. When this communication fails, what brings these two delicate characters back together is their physical passion for one another. Although they verbally stumble, there is no questioning of the love shown between them through the tender love-making which is in no way hidden or shamed. The directing of Connell and Marianne’s relationship upturns the romanticised teenage love affair that has been endlessly written and rewritten.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some scenes are so cripplingly true to life you wonder how the directors have managed to capture them. Marianne is shown as the taunted outsider at school, with a façade that her fierce refusal to make friends is through choice rather than being a vulnerable outcast. However we soon learn that she is a young woman who has been tormented from a life of mental abuse to the extent that it moulds her very sense of self. Connell’s poor treatment of Marianne during their schooldays is often infuriating to watch, as he is torn between keeping his place amongst his friends or following his heart and openly being with Marianne. Paul Mescal’s portrayal of Connell’s struggles with depression later on in the series are so raw they verge on being too powerful to watch. At moments during the series gone is the likeable, laid back Connell. Instead we see a young man who is utterly broken, so beaten down that he can’t even raise his head from his collapsed state as his university girlfriend Helen leaves him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Masterfully scripted and capturing with complete honesty the struggle of transitioning from teenage years into adulthood, ‘Normal People’ will continue to live with you and haunt you even after you have finished watching it. Its sometimes-slow pace will bring you to moments of frustration, but this is the magic that lies behind Abrahamson and Macdonald’s directing. It is as true a depiction of real life you will get on the screen, and much like life it doesn’t just wipe out the moments that are crude or awkward or uncomfortable. On the contrary, we feel them in full force through the brilliant acting of Daisy Edgar Jones and Paul Mescal in the roles of Marianne and Connell. This genius adaption of Rooney’s novel conveys the intensity of a first love while revealing the pain which inevitably comes alongside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/larakeville/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lara Keville</a></em></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/larakeville/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76bbebf22b4349a8a5bf356f09eb45b5?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Lara Keville\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/larakeville/\">Lara Keville</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>When did we stop playing? I mean <em>really</em> playing. Getting lost in imaginary worlds, pretending to be these fictional characters we&#8217;d invented in our brains that had all these gadgets and gismos that we could see so vividly in our minds. Being so creative that we&#8217;re full of excitement and wonder. Why did that all end? We&#8217;ve lost so much confidence in acting a fool and playing for fun. Tapping into our creativity seems like a colossal mountain to climb or a fire breathing dragon to fight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a small Saturday job at a performing arts academy where I help children act, sing and dance, allowing them to get their creative brains ticking and bodies moving in the world of performing arts. The ages vary but I find myself mostly working with the ages ranging from 13-18 – the high school age. The age of uncertainty, puberty and self-consciousness. This past weekend, a statement popped up from the high school group which made me want to dive in further.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were doing a task that required the kids to fully embody objects, silly objects, such as a knife or a pair of shoes. Objects that if you told a 5-year-old to re-enact they&#8217;d probably execute it perfectly. The group immediately became shy and uncomfortable as if we caught them picking their noses. They told us that people their age no longer do &#8216;stuff like that&#8217;, that they don&#8217;t play, and their imaginations have been replaced with &#8216;a more logical way of thinking&#8217;.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This really sadden me. They were describing their play and creativeness as a childhood pet that had died and then buried in a shoebox in their back gardens. It made me look at my own life as someone who waved goodbye to high school over 3 years ago to do a performance degree which was full of play and creativity. However, I recognised how much I&#8217;ve also changed since playing in the playground, and how conscious I can be when I&#8217;m being creative and silly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re taught to focus on the future, to work on the next step and the step after that and the step after that, and then we lose the fun and silliness along the way. From primary school we are taught to look forward to high school and what is expected of us there. High school contains GCSE&#8217;s that prepare us for A-Levels, which then prepare us for university or apprenticeships and careers, then BAM, just like that we&#8217;ve grown up and playing seems like centuries ago (which, for some of us, it has been).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked a question on my Instagram story whether others feel the same way, asking them why they also stopped playing. These are some of the responses I received:</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I was probably 11 or 12 when I stopped playing because it wasn’t ‘cool’ anymore. I think at the time when I started high school or even when I left primary school, my friend became interested in phones and boys, and I think I felt judged for not having the same interests which is probably why I stopped so I could fit in.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anon, 22-year-old</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I&#8217;ve still not stopped playing at the ripe age of 21, my job title is a playworker and I love it! Although, I’d say I played less throughout my teen years. I would say that would be down to fitting in with the rest of the crowd at school. Uni helped a lot (referring to BA Dance), I definitely think that involved a lot of play in terms of improvising etc and silliness.”</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anon, 21-year-old</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, playing comes and goes throughout our lives but never returns to the full extent of our primary school days, or the days where we’d play on the street with the kids from next-door. We have moments of silliness but only in a space where we feel comfortable to do so and some don’t ever find themselves in situations where those comfortable spaces are around. Play is a useful tool to have under our belts, allowing us to be free and creative that can build our confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When was the last time you really played, and would you consider letting loose a little? Maybe putting on your helmet and exploring space again, or picking up the sword and defeating the dragon, or simply talking complete gibberish to a friend for the fun of it. I think you’d be surprised at just how fulfilling it could be.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Maia Flora </em></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/maiaflora/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/549a6c6957b552929d1917e1f201163e?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Maia Flora\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/maiaflora/\">Maia Flora</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

The reality is something very different: negligence, a lack of respect and a denial of responsibility.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite our government’s claims of being a place of justice, freedom and equality, the British government is at the forefront of culpability when it comes to contributing to the refugee crisis. Britain has ordered it lawful to sell weapons to states with poor governance and human rights records (essentially what is causing so many to flee Sudan, Afghanistan, Iran and Syria).</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>“…rank hypocrisy [is] at the heart of UK foreign policy.</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>The government claims to stand for human rights and</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>democracy, but it is arming and supporting repressive</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>regimes and dictatorships around the world.”</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">&#8211; Campaign Against Arms Trade</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The British Arms Trade grotesquely profits from and contributes to the violence and turmoil which has been devastating countries in the Middle East. In Yemen, the continual bombing has wreaked havoc on people’s lives, ripping families, culture and communities apart. This has led to one of the most significant humanitarian crises we’ve seen today. Ironically, NGO’s in these countries are sustained by donations from a wide array of British charities. So, whilst many of us scramble money and/or resources to help those in the firing line, should we look more closely at those who are firing. To avoid sounding naïve, I am not talking about trying to prevent extremist groups from killing people as I am conscious that sounds quite unrealistic and possibly a little delusional. I am saying we need to focus on the root of the problem instead of the aftermath of the devastation. To put it more simply, we need to be aware of the fact that whilst British people are supplying donations, the British arms trades are supplying bombs. So, (without sounding too idealistic) being collectively aware of what’s going on and signing petitions, this could help be a catalyst in preventing this resolution to continue. Without bombs, there is no bombing. In taking steps to sign petitions or to educate yourself, we could help make selling these weapons illegal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a petition which concerns this issue: <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/326822\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/326822 .</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has become all too familiar to hear of refugees drowning at sea. In this year alone, more than 500 refugees and migrants are known to have died in the Mediterranean sea (the actual number is estimated to be significantly higher). According to the M.V. Louise Michel rescue boat, &#8220;European states [are] instruct[ing] their Coastguard not to answer distress calls from ‘non-Europeans’ leaving desperate people to drift helplessly at sea.” The Greek government has abandoned over 1000 migrants at sea in rafts since the beginning of 2020 and the EU continue to strike controversial control deals with Libya. These deals aim to reduce migrant flow by higher investments into detention centres and paying the militias. The militias are the Libyan military force and have been previously accused of robbing, torturing and child trafficking. In the past, NGO’s would rescue drowning migrants and transport them to Europe. Today, the EU and UK <em>fund</em> the militias to catch migrants and take them back to these horrific camps. Banksy’s latest rescue-boat mission (the Louise Michel) aimed to rescue without prejudice. They stated how borders and nationality should not make a difference to what rights one has and how we treat each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/refugee-2.jpg?resize=610%2C401&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2027\" width=\"610\" height=\"401\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>The Louise Michel is a rescue ship funded by the British street artist Banksy. Credit&#8230;Thomas Lohnes/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The EU still doesn’t recognise Non-European citizens drowning as a matter of emergency. As they wait to be rescued on the edge of the European borders, Europe and the UK turn a blind eye. Claire Faggianelli, (an activist who prepared the Louise Michel), said the project should serve as ‘a wake-up call for Europe’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recent fires in camp Moria may have served as a wake-up call for many. In 2016, the EU blocked migrants off from accessible routes into their countries and created camps which soon became squalid, inhumane and overcrowded. Moria camp was one of these. It was originally built to hold 3,000 people, yet the fires left 12,000 homeless (of whom 4,000 were children). With a growing number of residents testing positive for corona virus, there was a lack of adequate action and a roaring sense of neglect, which finally turned into raging fires engulfing the camp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>“There is no question as to the cause of this fire:</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>&nbsp;‘It’s the years-long orchestration of human</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>suffering and violence produced by European</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>and Greek migration policies’…the ashes of</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Moria are a testament to these policies of neglect.”</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">&#8211; Aurelie Ponthieu, MSF advisor on displacement</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>These fires were the culmination of years of silenced cries from the migrants. These people could no longer be ignored. Europe’s hardening approach to migrants was encapsulated with these foul detention camps. In the aftermath of the fires, ten EU countries agreed to take in the hundreds of unaccompanied children left homeless from Moria…the UK wasn’t one of them. This callous response from our government’s embodies its shocking approach to the migrant crisis as a whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the news we are usually informed of the mass numbers of migrants who require refuge in Europe or the UK. Although this is informative and spreads awareness, it can also cause panic or create hostility due to an overwhelming sense of a ‘crisis’. Empathy is usually the initial reaction, yet constant news can swamp people and cause them to switch off, which can subsequently strip migrants of their individuality and paint them as a wash of figures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the establishment of BREXIT, many studies demonstrate a spike of xenophobic hate crimes (which are still rising). Far right rhetoric encourages the scapegoating of many refugees for crime and economic struggles, instead of focusing on the billionaires who don’t pay tax. Just two months ago, Boris was outwardly considering changes to our asylum laws, with the aim to deter migrants. Britain steadily portrays the impression of helping with the refugee crisis yet does tremendously little compared to the rest of Europe. The UK’s shocking intake of migrants and refugees speaks volumes. Recently, 11 Syrian asylum seekers were left ‘hungry and homeless’ on the streets of Madrid, after the British government uprooted them &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/syrian-asylum-seekers-homeless-spain-home-office-a9705181.html\">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/syrian-asylum-seekers-homeless-spain-home-office-a9705181.html</a> .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We shouldn’t be leaving migrants to be shot on land, enclosed in camps and stranded at sea. Our government shouldn’t deny their own connection to this crisis. If you have the means to donate to any charities that provide respect, hope and safety for these people, please see the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Choose love</strong> &#8211; allows people to buy essential items from their stores, which are then sent to refugees. Thousands of their volunteers give out food and medical supplies. Donations also go to therapists helping those traumatised, and in funding lawyers to help reunite displaced families. <a href=\"https://choose.love/collections/shelter-collection\">https://choose.love/collections/shelter-collection</a> / <a href=\"https://choose.love/collections/merchandise\">https://choose.love/collections/merchandise</a></li><li><strong>Movement on the Ground</strong> &#8211; they are mainly working to restore morale and improve living conditions whilst increase connection for refugees with their host communities. Also helps in distributing funds to essential charities working alongside them. <a href=\"https://movementontheground.com/about-us\">https://movementontheground.com/about-us</a></li><li>The <strong>IRC</strong> works with those who are fleeing war, conflict, and natural disasters to help cure treatable conditions and ensure education during crises. They also help to prevent sexual violence perpetrated against refugee women and gives them their own money to help their independence. <a href=\"https://www.rescue-uk.org/how-help\">https://www.rescue-uk.org/how-help</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These are a few charities that are fundamental in providing a lifeline for these people while our government refuses to. Obviously donating isn’t the only thing you can do to help, there are many petitions you can sign or ways of educating yourself about our government’s complicity. The problem is not the migrant crisis, the problem is inequality, neglect and a lack of support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/katiegibson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">By Katie Gibson</a></em></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/katiegibson/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a2e83111706c4a8341f0371a8511d5b?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Katie Gibson\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/katiegibson/\">Katie Gibson</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

We aim to provide a stable income for our members (people who suffer from homelessness/mental and physical disabilities) through the sale of their artwork. We provide them with the tools and the support they need to produce art and then make their pieces available for purchase on our platform. The artists receive 50% of the profit from their piece and the rest of the money goes into furthering our mission and helping more artists. We also donate 10% of our profits to various charities that we work with such as St Vincent’s Blackfriars and CALM zone.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SAI-2.jpeg?resize=458%2C457&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2021\" width=\"458\" height=\"457\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SAI-2.jpeg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SAI-2.jpeg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SAI-2.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">HERD</a> spoke to Oscar to find out a little more about his Street Art Initiative journey, the challenges they&#8217;ve faced and the success stories which have followed:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and what you’re currently up to?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Oscar Slacke and I am 21 years old. I went to school in Hampshire and then went on to study Sociology at Newcastle University, but I dropped out after 1 year. I have since&nbsp;started up a food business and I also work in events. Through working I learned a lot about the wider community here in the North East, I then founded ‘Street Art Initiative’.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What inspired you to start the Street Art Initiative and how did you get the wheels in motion</strong>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of lockdown, I moved back up to Newcastle, I was stood in the queue for Tesco’s near where I live. There was a homeless man sat near the entrance and we got chatting, he told me how he ended up on the street and what he struggles with most day to day. He was anxious and worried about his future, especially with everything going on at the moment. He was clearly in distress and I felt so helpless. This, for me, was one of those moments that takes you aback and makes you re-assess what you are doing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I decided to start a massive food bank collection from students in Newcastle and the surrounding areas. Over 500 food items were donated in around a week, that I delivered to 2 different charities (St Vincent’s Blackfriars Centre and the WestEndFoodbank). I was truly amazed at the response from the students and the food donated helped those in need. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>About a week after the food bank donations I was trying to think of a more sustainable and long-term method in which I could help the community. I then came up with the idea for Street Art Initiative. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What have been your biggest challenges over the last few months</strong>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially our biggest challenge was finding the artists. Many factors made this hard, firstly because of COVID and everything having to be done online, it was a struggle to reach out to those who may not have access to social media. More recently our biggest challenge has been getting the artwork sold, we have 11 original pieces for sale currently and authentic prints of 2 of these pieces. We are constantly learning how best to market the pieces to the general public. We know that once a few of our pieces have sold it will cause a snowball effect and then we can bring in some much-needed funds for our artists. This project has been a challenge for me personally with trying to balance a work and social life also, but I wake up every day and genuinely enjoy cracking on doing my best to make a difference.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What have been the success stories so far / what has been the most rewarding moment?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we first launched there was a period of about 2 weeks in which we were searching and searching for artists that would benefit from our services. I then woke up one morning to an email from the lovely Aly Smith who said she heard about our organisation through a newsletter that had been put out. Aly suffers from Bipolar disorder along with a few other mental health diagnoses. I can’t describe the feeling I got when I received Aly’s email expressing her interest in joining Street Art Initiative as one of our members. We finally had the chance to make a real difference to someone’s life and do what we initially set out to do – give people opportunity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, there have been many other highs, signing our 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;artist – Mick who is partially sighted after an accident over lockdown which has caused him to now have scar tissue over his eyes. Mick has a wide range of landscape works that are currently for sale on our website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also recently had a short film made by two talented student videographers – Jonah and Jamie. When I first saw the video it almost brought a tear to my eye, it was so perfectly made and expressed everything I wanted to get across about Street Art Initiative.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the most rewarding part of running this Initiative is the people I meet. From our artists, to the people I work with, everyone is so inspirational in their own way and it brings a lot of light into the world that is much needed at the moment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is your vision for the future of the Street Art Initiative?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My vision for the future of Street Art Initiative is for it to be the main platform for disadvantaged artists to display and sell their artwork on in the UK. Alongside this I want it not only to be about selling the artwork but offering our artists the support network and mental health guidance that they might need in their day to day lives. We are looking to expand the Initiative to the south of England where we will mirror our work down there. I could not do any of this without the incredible people I work alongside including Imogen, Paree and Jess – they do an incredible job of supporting this initiative and keeping everything ticking along. Also, to Aly and Mick who are truly inspirational and have been an absolute pleasure to work with.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How can young people get involved and help ?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way in which young people can get involved is to spread the word about what we do here at Street Art Initiative. With every sale of one of our pieces, artists lives are dramatically changing. So, if you know anyone who may be interested in owning one of our pieces please do get in touch with us even if it’s just to have a chat. The way people can help in a broader sense is to be aware of their community and support it in any way you can, whether buying a sandwich for someone suffering on the street or donating to your local charity, it could even be smiling when you walk past someone – A lot of people are struggling right now and if you can brighten up someone’s day in any shape or form I think it’s something worth doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything you do helps no matter how small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Questions answered by Oscar Slacke, founder of Street Art Initiative. </strong></em></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/streetartinitiative/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fe7a71f2331dae20d641bb93bdd3042e?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Oscar Slacke\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/streetartinitiative/\">Oscar Slacke</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

With information no longer being restricted to the elites, we as individuals would have access to more news, perspectives, opportunities and ways of connection than at any other point in human history. Yet, the growing popularity of terms such as “information overload” and “post-truth politics” highlight the growing necessity of cultivating the skill of managing our attention online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be silly to dismiss just how beneficial our information-rich digital world has been for us. The possibility of informing ourselves on everything and anything is there at the tap of a thumb. &nbsp;On the flip side, however, this abundance of information also provides ample opportunities for more indulgent pursuits; ranging from taking a peek at our friends’ highlight reels for the day, to discovering that another one of our teenage idols is a conspiracy theorist – the list is endless. Many may argue that the sheer quantity of choice is a symbol of freedom, and that the “junk information” that exists within it is just part of the deal. Those who complain can just turn off their screens &#8212; It’s just willpower, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This line of argument, however, too easily dismisses the fact that we are required to navigate ourselves through the junk, as the algorithms do not work in our favour. Even if it is a price to pay for the freedom of choice, there’s still a more important question: does an awareness of what seems to be an endless amount of choices, opportunities and sources of information <em>really </em>make us free, or is it not another form of tyranny? Is this not making it more difficult for us to decipher the useful from the useless?</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know the obvious issues. Unless we’re super selective with our search filters, a quick trip online can result in being spammed with jobs, personalised ads, viral videos and anything else that competes for our attention. We can get lost in it all, pushing our brains to the limits of what they are able to efficiently process. Not to mention the endless discoveries of what we are missing out on, such as finding out what exotic location our not-so-social-distanced friend has ended up in, whilst we stand still in the aisle at Tesco, waiting patiently for the elderly lady in front of us to decide what brand of tinned tuna she fancies. Granted, the vast amount of options for distraction is a useful way to kill the monotonous aspects of a food shop, however the problem lies with the lack of control over the exposure we have to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know when we’re ingesting junk information, we know when we have moments of weakness, but we should not consider it a <em>personal</em> weakness when we find ourselves ingesting too much junk, given how much of it is engineered in a way that makes us crave more. Clickbait news that is focused on generating emotional responses, such as outrage, does so because outrage has an addictive quality to it, as much as we would hate to admit it, and this objective to trigger us emotionally works so well. It naturally becomes much easier and more appealing for us to ingest trending, concise 280-character opinions on Twitter than it is to reach out to more longform and “boring” content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re vulnerable to it all and it is the conditioning effects it has on us that make it an even bigger problem. Easy access puts virtues, such as patience, to the back of the queue, which no doubt contributes to the tribalism and general nightmare that we see today on social media platforms. If the news is reactionary, it’s no wonder that we follow suit. Still, it is unsustainable. Ingesting junk information feels good, but after a while, we end up losing sight of what is important. In the thick of it all, our ability in being able to determine what information is actually good and useful seems to disappear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we collectively want to get better at limiting ourselves to “healthy” sources of information, perhaps we should move on from talking about willpower and start by accepting the fact that we will always be drawn to junk information, as we are with junk food. Instead of taking a sabbatical a la Ross Geller, perhaps we should focus on taking the time to cleanse our feeds and make them work for us. We owe it to ourselves to become ruthless, by seriously considering whether what we are paying attention to online is either necessary, or at least beneficial to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can start small and mute our anti-masker Uncle’s posts on Facebook, eliminating that source of frustration, without having to worry about getting the death stare at Christmas dinner (whenever that is). We can block certain clickbait news sites that lack credibility, we can be brutal with our Instagram feed and assess what helps us and what (without intending to) drives that sense of inadequacy that most likely exists for no good reason. In the age of abundance, we’re always going to be missing out on something, so we might as well choose what that something is. It is not a sign of weakness that we have to remove the possibility of temptation in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If somebody who is on a diet has to witness their freezer tray being loaded up with ice cream on a daily basis, talk of willpower becomes pretty redundant when the option exists to just not have it there in the first place. In an information-rich world, with what appears to be an abundance of choices, opportunities and sources of information, just “doing more” and “learning more” won’t cut it anymore. With our brains only being able to efficiently process so much, information overload is becoming a growing problem. Perhaps our own digital freedom comes, ironically, by what we limit ourselves to. The algorithms do not work in our favour, and with the lack of control over what information we are exposed to, we should treat our attention as something that needs to be managed.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By David Rothwell</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/davidrothwell/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a758c2bb771c628b0112d20b7210277?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"David Rothwell\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/davidrothwell/\">David Rothwell</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Addiction, depression, anxiety and heightened self-consciousness all make up part of the dark side of social media – most of us are familiar with this in one way or another. However, are these mere side effects of the software we use, or is there something more sinister at play?</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the newest Netflix documentary-drama, <em>The Social Dilemma,</em> Jeff Orlowski is clearly showcasing how these dysfunctions are not simply accidents but come from an assumed desire to manipulate user behaviour, revealing how deeply these dark feelings and emotions are triggered, for the pure interest of increased monetisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What started off as something people genuinely thought would turn out to do good – creating real, meaningful, systemic changes, ended up becoming unethical. The algorithms of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or even Google are added to provide the human brain with the dose of dopamine necessary to make them addictive. These social media platforms all profit on user attention, which is paid for by advertisers. As the documentary showcases, the advertisers are therefore the customers, making us – the users – the products being sold to those customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the documentary, Jaron Lanier goes further in arguing that it’s not only our attention being sold as the product, but rather “the gradual, slight, imperceptible change in your own behaviour and perception that is the product.” Advertisers do this by changing the way we think, what we do and who we are through a very gradual change in what we see on our screens. In order for them to do that, they need a lot of <em>data,</em> which they get through constantly getting us to log in to online media platforms. What can be dangerous about this constant need for online attention is that we as users can very easily be drawn into addiction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tristan Harris, the president and a co-founder of the Centre for Humane Technology, explains that tech companies have three different goals:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>An engagement goal – to drive up our usage and to keep us scrolling.</li><li>A growth goal – to keep you coming back, whilst inviting more friends.</li><li>An advertiser goal – to make sure that the first two goals are happening in order for these platforms to keep making as much money as possible.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>These goals are all driven by algorithms that track and record our usage. This means that advertisers can bombard us with as much information as they want through the apps we use, whenever they want. What is most intriguing is that whilst we created a huge privacy scandal out of fake plumbers wiring the office of a political party during the Watergate Scandal, citizens around the world now voluntarily surrender all their personal information and their usage purely in exchange for the pleasure of using these apps. This thus can lead to surveillance capitalism – a new way in which our culture and politics are shaped without us even noticing it – through the use of targeted ads, notifications and other tactics. The real question to ask now is – if everything we see and do on our screens is monitored and manipulated – do we really have the ability to form our own opinions?</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"197\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Picture-1.pngyctui-1.jpg?resize=640%2C197&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1985\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Picture-1.pngyctui-1.jpg?w=954&amp;ssl=1 954w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Picture-1.pngyctui-1.jpg?resize=300%2C92&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Picture-1.pngyctui-1.jpg?resize=768%2C236&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The very meaning of culture and communication we are now so accustomed to is based around <em>manipulation</em>. There is a much bigger part at play than just reaching for your phone to see if you have a notification – we’ve only been programmed to do that because tech companies have invested in psychological researchers whose job it is to programme us into doing so. This brings us back to the original question – do we really have any control over what we do, or are we all becoming robots controlled completely by these tech companies for increased profit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sean parker, ex-president of Facebook and co-founder of Napster, explains that social media platforms would exploit the vulnerability in human psychology <em>consciously,</em> in order to get more user participation. This links back to the correlation between mental health decreasing with increased social media usage. As the documentary states, suicide rates and self-harm has only been increasing drastically since about 2011/2013 – right about the time social media platforms were on the rise. We end up curating our lives around false senses of perfection for short-term gratification, comparing ourselves to unrealistic standards of beauty and getting confused between likes on a post and real-life connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ongoing spread of fake news is also a dangerous side effect of social media. As highlighted in the documentary, an MIT study shows that fake news on twitter spreads 6 times faster than real fact-checked news. Therefore creating a disinformation for profit model, increasing the money made by tech giants through users spreading and propagating fake news on their platforms. This can, in turn, lead to increased polarisation, and tribalism. With the rapid spread of fake news on social media sites paired with a shared interest in believing misinformation, where is the need to compromise with others who might not share the same opinion as us? This makes it even harder for people to see eye to eye and to talk and discuss potentially hard topics. A perfect example of this is the mass amounts of misinformation being spread about COVID-19 and how we can overcome it, leading to anti-maskers protesting because they would rather believe a fake post on Facebook over scientists with PhDs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the decreasing personal control we have over what we look at on our screens, it is extremely easy to have our beliefs skewed through social media. It is mass manipulation of public opinion at its core, leaving close to no space for users to self-determine what they genuinely believe. But are these online platforms really all that bad? Certain people advocate that without implementing strong measures like dismantling or even banning them, a second chance at a better future is no longer possible. Fiscally, there is absolutely no incentive for these tech companies to stop what they are doing due to the clear goal keeping them going = profit at all costs. It’s inherent capitalism – putting the interest of the big corporations before the needs of the users being affected by these problems. However, it seems that certain stakeholders remain hopeful, voicing that through the implementation of tighter regulations, it is indeed possible to preserve the positive sides of social media whilst eradicating the negatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we need to remember is that this is not new. Radio, for example, is credited to have supported the raise of Nazism in the 1920s and 1930s, exploiting an economic and social crisis. We also need to be conscious that history tends to repeat itself, and that this is often amplified through the creation of new systems. Whatever your opinion is on social media, if there is one thing we can all take from watching <em>The Social Dilemma</em> it’s that we all need to be more critical and aware of the dangers of these systems, and try our best to do better to break away from toxic habits that come from using them.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/annameerson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">By Anna Meerson</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/annameerson/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0777620f2a2b8aff9221be801efb5331?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Anna Meerson\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/annameerson/\">Anna Meerson</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Harry Anslinger, the man who single handedly criminalised marijuana and was the first to coin the phrase ‘War on Drugs,’ was also the man that stated, “I have already made up my mind, do not try and confuse me with the facts.” This phrase not only sums up the failures of the War on Drugs but the general failures in almost all elements of governance and policy. Propaganda, politics and money have a far greater impact on policy than fact and science do and it is imperative that we demand change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, smoking was found to be incredibly harmful as early as the 1950s however smoking in pubs was only banned by the UK in 2008. As late as the 1990s all of the CEOs of American tobacco companies stood up under oath and swore smoking was non-addictive.The science had been proven years ago that it of course was, however, policy has always followed propaganda over fact. By looking at the policies surrounding drug criminality and climate change this pattern becomes more and more obvious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The aforementioned racist Harry Anslinger spearheaded cannabis prohibition in the USA in the 1930s as a way to to demonise and criminalise minorities. Cannabis started to be referred to as marijuana in order to associate it with the ‘dangers’ of Mexican immigration. He stated that made people go crazy, have murderous fits and that black men were using it to lure white women to have sex with them (a fear that has long plagued white America despite interracial rape historically being committed far more by white men on black women).</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>He called him an “axe-murdering, marijuana addict” yet after the autopsy no trace of marijuana was found; he had instead acted on his schizophrenia.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As early as 1944 scientists released the LaGuardia Report that found marijuana was non-addictive, not a gateway drug and that it did not lead to the propensity to commit major crimes. However, Anslinger’s propaganda had already infiltrated the public consciousness by using the famous case of Victor Licata who killed his entire family with an axe. He called him an “axe-murdering, marijuana addict” yet after the autopsy no trace of marijuana was found; he had instead acted on his schizophrenia. However, Anslinger shouted the loudest and created a hysteria in the public consciousness that obsessed over the dangers of this new drug.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then marijuana prohibition has become a tool to utilise against minorities and criminalise groups that are a threat to the system. In the 1960s the civil rights activists and the anti-war hippies posed this threat thus the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 classified marijuana as being a Schedule I drug meaning that it is supposedly worse than fentanyl, meth and oxycontin. It is for the same reason that the sentence for crack cocaine is 18 times longer than powdered cocaine despite being chemically identical &#8211; people the government see as a threat are heavily criminalised and policed whereas Wall Street and suburbia’s frequent cocaine habits do not pose such threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately the UK, as they do on most matters of policy, followed suit with the US and heavily criminalised marijuana and heavily racialised their policing of the drug too. A country that changed course and did something remarkable &#8211; listened to the country’s top scientists &#8211; was Portugal who decriminalised all drugs in 2000. They used all the money that would have gone towards locking people away to instead reconnect them with society and since then addiction and overdoses has dramatically decreased.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stigma created around cannabis and other drugs by US politicians with a racist agenda has become ingrained in the public consciousness and in the US and UK has led to increased incarceration and racialised policing. In places like the Philippines it has led to the deaths in cold blood of 20,000 since 2016 by President Duerte and his anti-drug agenda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The US Government couldn’t make it illegal to be black or a hippy so they criminalised the things they associated with them. Similarly, they couldn’t allow climate activists to encourage market regulation so they denied climate change and attacked any scientist who argued against that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scientific data and research of the impact humans are having on the environment has been around for almost half of a century yet the steps we have taken to counteract these effects have been negligible at most. Why? Because profits speak louder than human welfare. Fossil fuel companies such as Shell whose annual revenue is $345 billion are able to control the political atmosphere and fund a worldwide denial machine with the sole aim of disproving scientific research.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>The Koch brothers alone gave $67m to climate denial groups as their business is within top 15 of highest polluters in the USA and they also gave $400m to conservative political candidates in the 2012 elections.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1990, many corporations who were anti climate change action joined the purposefully ambiguous Global Climate Coalition that&#8217;s main aims were to discredit science, promote sceptics and think tanks and stress uncertainty. The amount of money which was then flooded into anti-climate thinking exemplifies the threat which it posed to their profits: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/26/koch-brothers-americans-for-prosperity-rightwing-political-group\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Koch brothers</a> alone gave $67m to climate denial groups as their business is within top 15 of highest polluters in the USA and they also gave $400m to conservative political candidates in the 2012 elections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This directly affects politics and thereby, policy. David Inhofe, who famously brought a snowball onto the Senate floor to prove climate change was a hoax, funnily enough received vast funding from the Koch Brothers and EXXon Mobil. Not only are denialists and politicians backed by enormous amounts of capital, they employ charismatic TV personalities to ‘debate’ with climate scientists. Scientists are not known for their charisma and the ‘denial machine’ is aware &#8211; they do not need to win the arguments, they just need to make the audience aware of the scientists boring answers and lack of charisma in order to devalue the very real things they are talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marc Morano, one of the most fervent denialists (who is heavily funded by fossil fuel backed think tanks and works for Senator Inhofe) stated you need to “go after individuals; you can’t just go after a system.” He posts emails and other personal information about climate scientists in order to discourage them from continuing their work. Katherine Hayhoe, said that when her email got posted on Morano’s website she received more than two hundred emails in a day that threatened the safety of herself, her family and her colleagues. If any more proof was needed on the realities of climate change within the last week California has had its second, third and fourth worst fires ever and Colorado had both fire and snow in the same area in a single day. Yet the man in charge calls climate change a hoax in order to protect the profits of his businesses and their associates. Meanwhile thousands of Americans are rotting in prison for marijuana possession charges while White America profits from the same plant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is more important than ever in this era of disinformation and fake news that the science and the facts from legitimate sources are focused on and not the sponsored drivel that comes from the politicians and mass media. I used climate change and drugs as an example but this is endemic to all elements of policy in any capitalist system especially with gun legislation, animal agriculture and the pharmaceutical industry. Increased profits will always be valued higher than human safety by corporations and politicians &#8211; Trump yesterday admitted to deliberately downplaying the severity of Covid in order to protect the economy. This is not a new issue and it will certainly continue as long as we allow those who control the capital to also control policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Two fascinating documentaries on these issues are:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Grass is Greener (Netflix)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Merchants of Doubt (documentarymania.com)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/maxcoleman/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">By Max Coleman</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/maxcoleman/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7023fde74da06f2898eaf3492eb2da99?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Max Coleman\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/maxcoleman/\">Max Coleman</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

The bespoke collection, which is designed and created in London, will consist of three items: a one-shoulder crop top, tracksuit bottoms and a hoodie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/chess2.jpg?resize=510%2C678&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2010\" width=\"510\" height=\"678\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We asked founder and creative director Chess Linney some questions about her background and why she started the luxury brand: </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong>What’s your background and what inspired you to start the brand?</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst working for a fashion PR agency based in Shoreditch, I was given a unique insight into how brands are able to utilize social media and influencer marketing techniques to promote their latest collections. I was fascinated to learn how such simple, yet effective methods resulted in memorable and unique campaigns. I thoroughly enjoyed the more creative aspects of the role as well as meeting up and coming professionals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This experience complimented my enthusiasm for UK youth culture and inspired me to start creating my own collection. I have found this process incredibly rewarding as I have seen my ideas progress into garments that I am proud to wear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong>What have been the biggest challenges on your journey so far?</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been somewhat of a challenge to start a business during the pandemic as there have been various unexpected challenges along the way. Finding the right manufacturer has been the largest obstacle to overcome as production lead times have changed and been extended due to various issues along the supply chain. It has however always been important to maintain the ethos of the brand to ensure the quality of the garments is maintained, whilst also achieving a comfy fit. This process has taken an extended amount of time but was necessary in order for the quality of the clothing to mirror consumer expectations. From the initial phases of launching the brand, I have placed emphasis on the importance of each garment being locally manufactured.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong>Why should young people be excited about LinneyLondon?</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The aim of my first capsule collection was born out of a desire to offer a fresh take on streetwear for the younger generation. The collection aims to inspire and unite people together with a common sense of style and comfort. It is essentially a brand designed by the youth for the youth, ensuring nothing but the highest quality garments and a nod to the brands 90s grunge influences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong>What have you got planned for the future?</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The future direction of the brand will look at releasing a limited number of items for different seasonal drops throughout the year. Each collection will comprise of two to three tracksuits, different variations of top’s and t-shirts with plans to offer accessories also. Following our first launch, I look forward to expanding the sizes available to reach a fully inclusive range of clothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/chess4.jpg?resize=369%2C549&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2011\" width=\"369\" height=\"549\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/chess4.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=369%2C549&amp;ssl=1 738w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/chess4.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=369%2C549&amp;ssl=1 1107w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More details about the brand: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The collection is inspired by youth culture with the desire to offer something new to the younger generation, ensuring nothing but the comfiest fit. Available in sizes small, medium and large, these items are a wardrobe must have to enhance your look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>‘It’s amazing to be launching Linney London, a collection inspired by my love for fashion and streetwear which is something I’ve been passionate about for years. It’s surreal to view my ideas turn into a unique collection and I’m excited for the future of the brand. Each collection aims to inspire and unite people together with a common sense of style’</em> said Linney London’s Founder and Creative Director, Chess Linney.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first collection offers a limited drop, consisting of three garments in three colourways. Each garment is handmade by our London based manufacturer. It is extremely important that each garment is made in the UK as well as using the highest quality fabrics to create the perfect fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first drop consists of a one shoulder top, tracksuit bottoms and hoodie. Each item can be found in one of the three colourways of white, black and baby blue in sizes S-L.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of the sets has its own name:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>White (Kai)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baby Blue (Cora)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Black (Miya)</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/chess3.jpg?resize=353%2C468&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2012\" width=\"353\" height=\"468\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/chess3.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=353%2C468&amp;ssl=1 706w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/chess3.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=353%2C468&amp;ssl=1 1059w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To find out more about the new collection and Linney London, visit<strong>:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.linneylondon.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">www.linneylondon.com</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find LinneyLondon on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/linneylondon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Instagram</a>: </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For more information, please contact: </em><a href=\"mailto:LINNEYLONDON@outlook.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LINNEYLONDON@outlook.com</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/admin/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6732f8a705abdd596d0c587bb01459b7?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Herd Community\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/admin/\">Herd Community</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Here I am once again writing about the complete shit show that is COVID-19, wondering “when will this finally be over?”, knowing full well that the answer is &#8211; no one actually knows. Since my last article quite a lot has happened, relatively speaking of course. BoJo and Priti Patel told neighbours to dob each other into the police if rules are broken. Local lockdowns intensified as the virus spread at an alarming rate. The government blamed young adults for the sudden rise in cases, pubs have to close by ten and, as of Monday, I have to wear a mask at work for the entirety of my shifts. Yes, it’s been quite a week or two, or however long it has been because it’s all starting to blur into one right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the new restrictions that have been announced this week, I thought I’d take another gander at the comment sections of everyone’s favourite socials to see what the Karens, Alans and Steves of the world have to say about the situation at hand (immediate apologies if your name is Karen, Alan or Steve).</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, it seems that a lot of people are trying their hand at being a stand-up comedian as soon as anything is announced. My favourite joke at the minute being, “take it Covid is on the night shift now?”. Ha, nice one! Now comments like this are a prime example of people who like to put their two pence in without having any real conviction. It’s the equivalent of a well-timed “your Mam” joke, yet, it’s something that I hear quite often now, and it comes as no surprise. I won’t pretend that closing pubs at ten will make any difference in my eyes. It’s like the government is oblivious to the fact that the restriction will just make people go to the pub earlier and drink quicker. It’s one of those random restrictions that scream “we know we have to do something, but we really don’t have a clue as to what!”, which seems to generate outrage more than anything else. Nevertheless, the one positive from this restriction is that they’ve decided to keep pubs open instead of shutting them altogether. I almost think that it’s becoming a game of appeasement; it’s either piss everyone off by shutting the pubs down or piss off those who regularly stay out past ten in their local instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This next comment was refreshing and summed up exactly how I feel about this whole situation. It reads, “I want to be optimistic, but this just feels like they’re pissing in the wind” (sad emoji face for emotional emphasis). It’s a brilliant phrase, let&#8217;s be honest. As a general consensus I think that we can all agree that the government has reacted poorly throughout the whole pandemic, but who&#8217;s to say that any other government would have reacted any better? These are unprecedented times after all. The difficulty I have with the situation is that we seem to be a step behind every time. Every decision our government makes is reactionary rather than precautionary, and instead of accepting any responsibility when it’s due, they just stir the pot further by blaming someone different every week. To think they had the audacity to blame carers at one point is beyond me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember when everyone stood and clapped for the NHS, mustering community spirit despite having total bellends at the helm? It seems like a while ago because that sense of community spirit has wavered a little bit. Neighbours are being urged to turn each other in like the plot of a George Orwell novel as the situation continues to feel more hopeless; especially when phrases such as ‘critical’ and ‘level 4’ are being thrown around &#8211; I never knew that we were even on a level system &#8211; when the only solution is reducing the size of weddings and a curfew. The difficulty with that sort of language is that it is click bait-y; it gets people panicked (myself included) without there being any logical action or conclusion to follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also obvious that people are calling for schools to be closed which is a really difficult one. It came as no surprise that cases began to rise as schools, colleges and universities reopened. In this situation you’ve got to think of the collateral damage that closing schools once again would have. With kids out of school, parents will have to stay home which takes them away from their jobs (which they have probably only just returned to) which, in turn, damages the economy even further. It’s a slippery slope, but when will they make this decision and when they do will it be too late? Perhaps it will be when the critical level rises to 5, or 6 … or 7?</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, it is almost certain that any decision made from here on out will be misguided, disputed and most likely ignored by a high amount of people. As for me, I’ll probably just keep writing highly opinionated articles in an attempt to squash my growing social angst.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/jamesmerrington/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">By James Merrington</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/jamesmerrington/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/03327dbffc8918dbdd4260cf05f0ba40?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"James Merrington\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/jamesmerrington/\">James Merrington</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">A 2016 study by Gallup reports that only “29% of Millennials are actively engaged in their job.” This trend of being disengaged in your career is set to continue through future generations. But why is it that so many young people are unhappy in their careers and what can we do about it? The amount of advice we receive from friends, family and even successful people about how to guide our careers is almost overwhelming. Yet, over the last decade more and more young people have been straying from the traditional wisdom not only to find more fulfilling jobs, but to set in motion careers that can make the world a better place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re the sort of person that is still searching for happiness and fulfilment in your career, or if you haven’t found inspiration from the traditional careers advice to “Follow your passion” or “Do what you’re good at”, then having a career on purpose could be for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a career on purpose is a new approach to finding a fulfilling career. It’s not that the traditional advice is bad or wrong but, as we know, it doesn’t work for everyone. Guiding your career on purpose is the process of clarifying an inspiring and personal reason that you want to go to work, beyond just a pay-cheque.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Critics may say that the purpose of a job is solely to make money – plain and simple. But you can make money in almost any job, so this thought process doesn’t help guide our careers, it only justifies them. For the average person, one third of your life is spent at work. One third. If you are expecting to spend a third of your life disengaged and unhappy, I believe you are selling yourself short and limiting your potential unnecessarily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because you can make money in almost any job, one way to find fulfilment in our jobs is to guide our careers by a different compass. Your purpose isn’t something new you need to make. It’s already concrete in your past through the way you have positively helped others and made an impact in the world. You just need to uncover it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason having a career on purpose can be more inspiring than the advice to “do what you’re passionate about” is because following your passion isn’t the only way to enjoy your career. Similarly, the advice to simply “do what you’re good at” is aimed at success in our careers, usually at the expense of our personal fulfilment and wellbeing. I believe that following your <em>purpose</em> allows us to not only enjoy every day at work, but to also have a career doing something we’re good at. The bottom line is that having a positive impact on others creates a fulfilling career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way we can use a purpose guided career to enhance our jobs and allow us to make a real difference in the world is by giving difficult decisions common context. We all make difficult decisions in our careers. Whether it’s accepting a lower paying job that we think will be more enjoyable, going to university or higher education against starting your career earlier, or perhaps which advice to take from successful people. It is hard to know what decision is right for us. If we are searching for more fulfilling careers we need to guide our decision on what has motivated us to help others throughout our lives. This is our purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to find your personal purpose and begin to create a more fulfilling and satisfying career, you need to look back at your life and the way in which you have helped others. Write down the ways that throughout your life you have added genuine value to &nbsp;the lives of others. Next, detail how you did this; if you are an artist or musician perhaps you <em>create</em> to have a positive impact, through sports this could be <em>inspire</em>, or from a more data oriented approach to having a positive impact this may be <em>analyse</em> or <em>organise</em>. For each time you can recall that you have had a positive impact on others and made the world a better place, detail how you did it. Lastly, you need to understand <em>why</em> you did it. Were you making someone happier? Were you helping people reach potential? Or did you do it to get higher performance for a goal or task? If your ‘why’ was working towards something bigger than yourself like climate change, <em>why</em> is that something you pursue? What’s the bottom line that you are trying to impact through your action?</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trends you can see in <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> you help others are proof that throughout your life you have been guided by a hidden force. A purpose that helps others and makes the world a better place. To use what has guided and brought you happiness in your career, you must ask yourself “how does each decision guide me towards my purpose and what I know is genuinely important to me?” If you guide your career on what you know has motivated you to make a positive impact throughout your life, you can have confidence that this will guide you towards a fulfilling and satisfying career making the world a better place.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Jake Richings</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/jakerichings/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/61ec2e836ca3b7534b5c3387bf7dfeb0?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Jake Richings\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/jakerichings/\">Jake Richings</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Birthdays. Eagerly awaited by some, dreaded by others. An annual marker of the passing of time, the ticking clock. For some, it’s a day that extends into an entire month, materialising as an abundance of hedonistic ventures and excuses to knock back the Prosecco every night. For others, it remains a day-that-shall-not-be-named, preferably breezed over like a minor pothole in the road; significantly insignificant, buried in the back of the mind and only discussed in hushed voices. Once urging the years on, we now will them to slow down, dreading the climbing number of our age like an electricity bill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the earlier days, it was the thrill of a packet of Marlborough, ridding the paranoia of a fake I.D and striding into the 15-rated film at the cinema with confidence. Later it becomes the beckoning of the menopause, freedom bus passes and wrinkled foreheads. Though many live in denial of birthdays (my aunt has turned 21 for the past 45 years) and see ageing as a social construct which we don’t have to adhere to. Birthdays remain a constant throughout our ever-lengthening lifespans. Hence, they function as both a personal and a universal marker, enabling us to reflect upon how society has changed and developed over the years, through the culture and rituals around this annual celebration. With technology having drastically affected our means of connectivity and communication during my brief time on this earth, each birthday exists as different chapter in this social evolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Somewhere in my house exists a plastic folder, stuffed full of birthday cards from my youngest years, yellowing with time. Though short and sweet, these cards were utterly reliable and much anticipated, arriving prematurely through the letterbox like clockwork. They sat promisingly on the hall table – a true test of patience – the warm familiarity of Grandma’s cursive alongside that of an obscure, distant family member who never missed a year. Balloons, streamers and a Barbie cake were all it took to please. An oversized, light-up badge for the special years. During school time, it was the honour of bringing in cupcakes for the class, and the relished – albeit temporary – popularity that came with that. During holidays, balloons tied to the front door were all that notified the occasion to the outside world, alongside a disco-ball, Britney spears, marzipan fuelled bash if you were fortunate. The only time spent near a phone was the reliable call of my Grandparents, singing ‘happy birthday’ down the line in glorious canon. Every year. Without fail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>BBM (Blackberry Messenger) was a phase that took the Millennials and Gen Z’s of this nation by storm. A notable shift in the pace of conversation and accessibility, a time soundtracked by the collective clicking of plastic keys and the threat of thumb strain. On birthdays, the iconic red light would flash in overdrive, illuminating like a firework display. Phones glued to palms, scarcely coming up for air amongst the flood of messages, we began to acclimatise to this new volume of attention we were receiving on our birthday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The accumulation of a triple-figure catalogue of Facebook friends had a colossal impact on birthday culture. When Facebook was still in its prime, birthdays involved a mass inundation of public wall-posts and declarations of appreciation – helpfully prompted by a notification. “Friends” re-emerged from every corner of life, plastering your Facebook wall with messages of varying sentiment:</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Happy Bday’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘HBD x’</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lacking in charm, maybe, but racking up the quantity nonetheless, and successfully helping surpass last year’s haul. Well-wishes from friends of varying integrity: your oldest friend; a girl you met at Butlins aged 7; a stranger you snogged at a house-party once last year – whose name you didn’t know; that infamous year above, who you wouldn’t dare share eye contact with the following morning at school. They all played a vital role, contributing to the dopamine-filled day you had looked forward to the previous year. A lingering stamp of popularity, proof of your worth, stacked up neatly on your profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obligatory photo collages from your best friends were to be expected. A collection of your most undignified and unrefined moments from the past 12 months, and entire lifetime, captured and stashed for this special day. Evidence of memories you need no reminding of. Perhaps the aftermath of a whole bottle of Glenn’s vodka in the park, dusted off and brought to light year upon year. Your intimate moments revealed to everybody, a gift of pre-meditated humiliation from your nearest and dearest. Implicit competition between the friends, the quality of collage a direct intimation to place in the social hierarchy – the more spectacular the collage, the most legitimate the friendship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of years ago, Facebook began a slow, withering demise in the eyes of the young generations. Instagram took centre stage, as the former was left to rot, kept alive only as a sprawling address book of everyone we’ve ever met, and by middle-aged gardeners sharing snapshots of their allotment successes. With this, came an ambiguity around birthday etiquette. Still, on our birthdays, we turned to Facebook for its previous gratification, to now be met with a disheartening response: birthday posts that you could count on one hand, from the stragglers who hadn’t yet got the note about moving on. A tumbleweed rolls across our profiles along with the whistling of sinking hearts and deflated egos. But rather than a sign of social extradition, this was just a sign that communication had progressed and birthday culture would soon adapt to its new home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instagram has now been part of our lives for a decade, growing and metamorphosing alongside us over this time. Once just a place for poor quality photographs and rainbow filters, it’s now a superpower that has taken worldwide interconnectivity into a whole new realm. It functions simultaneously as a tool for business, a political platform, an artistic portfolio, a dating-profile, a means of communication, social promotion, and a personal mood board. With the mass migration to Instagram, birthday culture has thus adapted into what it is now…</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike Facebook, Instagram doesn’t dutifully remind followers of the birthdays, hence it has become our personal responsibility to prompt people ourselves. We must lace the feed with triggers, so that our followers simply cannot miss news of the big day. Be it photos of ourselves basking in the ‘birthday glow’ and surrounded by silver helium balloons or sporting a plastic tiara, with the caption “21!”. After giving a gentle nudge, we can sit back and watch our handiwork unfurl, taking the form of likes, comments and messages. Facebook collages have now been replaced by Instagram ‘stories’, chopped up into a million mini morsels of appreciation and odes to the past, and length the new measure of appreciation. We watch as images of our face spread across social media like wildfire, resharing these ‘stories’ of our time on earth to our own profiles, for all of those that might have missed the previous prompt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shops such as Paperchase and Scribbler have succeeded in keeping the birthday card alive and relevant. Though, they are far less common, frequently crude or based around an avocado-themed pun. Websites such as Moonpig have also helped shift card-giving into the contemporary. Possibly instilled in me by a Mother who wrote me a card for every possible occasion – ‘good luck,’ ‘well done,’ ‘thinking of you,’ or ‘just a note.’ I am still a great advocate for the power of the birthday card. I also believe it has taken on a whole new weight. A symbol that you are worth the time and effort spent writing those words. The intimacy and closeness felt through the ink, smudged by their hand. The lick of their saliva sealing the envelope. The knowledge that you were in someone’s thoughts, before you reminded them. Though less fruitful that it used to be, receiving the post on my birthday might still be the thing I look forward to the most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the torrent of contact and hype we now experience on our birthday, thanks to social media, I can’t deny feeling a little empty when the day comes around. Although full on emojis and gif-laden photographs, I find myself unsatisfied. The love feels removed, trapped behind the glass of my phone screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technology has connected us to a number of people – simply unfathomable two decades ago – however, this dissatisfaction implies to me that it is not the number but the quality of relationships that feel significant on my birthday. I would argue that, through the process of evolution, birthday culture has lost some of the effort, thought and care that makes the day feel noteworthy. There remains something in the handwritten card, the bunch of flowers, the home-made cake, the phone call, that can’t be emulated through social media; a physical manifestation of love and thought that feels tangible between your two hands. A sense of true human connectivity that we desire on this one day each year. Something that Instagram alone will never quite fulfil.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Gabriella Conn </em></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/gabriellaconn/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/836290fb7b5fa0e9903fe30ee5638ec8?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Gabriella Conn\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/gabriellaconn/\">Gabriella Conn</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Second Hand September is back for a second year and once again, Oxfam are asking people to shop second hand throughout September, to help protect people and planet from the impacts of fast fashion. Every week 13 million items of clothing ends up in UK landfill, so choosing to shop second hand can make a difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oxfam has been doing the reusing and reselling thing since the 1940s, when the first Oxfam Shop opened. Then years later in 1974, Oxfam became the first national charity to develop its own facility for recycling and reusing clothes that never sends clothes to landfill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oxfam’s pioneering sorting facility, is called Wastesaver. Oxfam’s team at Wastesaver works hard to resell, reuse or recycle donated items &#8211; ensuring clothes continue their journey. Over 14,000 tonnes of clothing are diverted from landfill through being donated to Oxfam every year. Check out this <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/oxfamGB/videos/322036969030538\">video</a> of my colleague Ben from the Oxfam Festival Shop Team, talk through what we do at Wastesaver.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image .wp-caption .wp-caption-text { font-size: 20px; }\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"368\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Zara-2.jpg?resize=368%2C368&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1922\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Zara-2.jpg?w=368&amp;ssl=1 368w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Zara-2.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Zara-2.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Photo credit: Tom Craig</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Michaela Coel the BAFTA award-winning actor, director, screenwriter, producer, playwright and poet is joining us to champion this year’s campaign.

I visited the shop on the first day to check it out and it was truly fantastic!

From hand-me downs from family or friends, to weekend outings to the charity shops with my Nan. Its these habits as a child that has always made me a big fan of bargains and thrifting. But I also got sucked into the world of fast fashion, trying to follow the never-ending trends and sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zara-1-new.jpg?resize=495%2C369&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1940\" width=\"495\" height=\"369\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zara-1-new.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zara-1-new.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=495%2C369&amp;ssl=1 990w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zara-1-new.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=495%2C369&amp;ssl=1 1485w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Photo credit: Zara Canfield</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Its now been 14 months without buying new clothes and I have loved every minute of it!

I also started the process of unfollowing influencers who promote fast fashion hauls and instead replaced them with sustainable fashion accounts including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/oxfamgb/\">@OxfamGb</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/oxfamfestshop/\">@Oxfamfestshop</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/laurenbravo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@LaurenBravo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/theniftythrifter_/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@theniftythrifter_</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Declutter and get to know your wardrobe</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can be a long but a very worthwhile process – you won’t regret it! I owned so much that I had forgotten what I had in my wardrobes (yes plural).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I decided to Marie Kondo my life! I managed to do my own fashion stock check and designate items to be donated, swapped and sold on. After doing this I also recommend bringing items to the front that have been hidden and forgotten about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t be afraid to be an outfit repeater! If you love something why not wear it more often.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Sell, Give, Swap!</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going without fast fashion does not mean going without!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When your clothes have finished their life in your wardrobe – give them a new lease of life. This can be done in several ways including donating them to an Oxfam shop, so you can help raise money to fight poverty around the world. Just one dress could raise enough money to buy drought-resistant seeds for a family to keep growing food despite a changing climate- amazing right?!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the time you have and how many items you no longer want to keep, there are a few ways you can make some money back. I usually sell items when I have a little more time on my hands, or I am saving up for something. You can also sell items and give the money you make to charity too!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1111.jpg?resize=581%2C429&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1949\" width=\"581\" height=\"429\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1111.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=581%2C429&amp;ssl=1 1162w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1111.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=581%2C429&amp;ssl=1 1743w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>&nbsp;Photo credit: Rosalia Mendes</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Need a wardrobe refresher?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why not organise a clothes swap with a group of close friends, colleagues at work or in your community? Sadly, with social distancing guidelines, this will be difficult to do on a large scale. So recently I have taken photos of items and sent them in a group chat with friends. They can then request any items they would like and I then donate the rest to my local Oxfam shop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Need some retail therapy?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By choosing to shop second hand you can save great clothes from needlessly ending up in landfill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also refresh your wardrobe at a fraction of the price by buying clothes and accessories from high street charity shops or online on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org.uk/shop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Oxfam Online Shop</a>, eBay, Depop and Vinted. I have bought some amazing pieces over the last year with many being brand new and unworn by the previous owner #winning!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to keep up with the latest trend</strong>? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why not ‘window shop and search’? This is the term I have given for when I may have seen an item I really like that a friend or maybe a celebrity/influencer has worn or possibly something I have seen when walking past a shop window. I will then try to find it second hand!

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I first heard of Banksy back in 2018, when the famous painting, <em>Girl With Balloon</em>, was shredded for the world to see, right after it was sold for $1.4 million at an exclusive Sotheby’s auction. From then on – like many of us – I was captivated by both his art and the secrecy of the man behind it. Who was this mysterious man whose ‘urge to destroy’<em>, </em>as he himself explained it, was not only artistic but loyal to his apparent mission of making art accessible to all and, most importantly, making art a changing force?</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Banksy’s street paintings have always been characterised for challenging the status quo, and raising important questions around politics, inequality and culture. More importantly, his pieces are often ones that inspire the viewer to reflect upon our world and the way in which it works. Unlike other artists, Banksy has become an inspiring figure whose actions show that the time to wait for government action has passed and the power to create change lies in every single one of us, a belief reflected in his recent purchase of a vessel dedicated to help immigrants stranded in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of weeks ago, hundreds of migrants sailed across the Mediterranean in search of a new life in Europe. On August 27<sup>th </sup>, a former French navy ship, the Louise Michel, funded by Banksy, took 89 migrants on board and another further 130 people. At that point, the ship with 10 highly qualified crew issued a <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/29/europe/banksy-rescue-boat-louise-michel-assistance-scli-intl/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">distress call</a> due to overcrowding issues. The vessel, which was near the Italian island of Lampedusa, a place that has become a common target for many migrants, initially received assistance from SeaWatch 4 and had to wait until later that same day to finally receive help from the Italian Coast Guard, which then only took in 49 of the passengers in the most critical conditions. Banksy did not let the opportunity to make a statement through his art pass, and so spray painted the Louise Michael to create the image of a girl in a life vest reaching for a heart-shaped lifebelt – resembling the renowned piece – a picture that is frightening to see given it depicts the conditions of many children aboard these vessels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Banksy also took to social media platforms to condemn the lack of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/30/world/europe/banksy-rescue-boat-louise-michel.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">proper assistance</a> for migrants in these desperate situations. On his own Instagram account, he posted a video that showed a tiny lifeboat, overcrowded with migrants, in distress along with an important message: ‘<em>Like many people who make it in the art world, I bought a yacht to cruise the med. It’s a French navy vessel we converted into a lifeboat because EU authorities deliberately ignore distress calls from ‘non-Europeans.’</em> The video clearly addressed the double standards in both the artistic industry and governmental institutions, even showing a sleeping officer apparently ignoring a boat’s emergency call.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But why is it important to look not just at the current situation of Banksy’s boat but the intention behind it? While unfortunately his post was certainly met with negative opinions, with many people asking who would later provide shelter or jobs to these people or why should countries that are closer to the coast take the biggest intake. Within this context, Banksy has most certainly provided these people with a humanitarian hand but more importantly he is spreading a message of hope and cultural understanding, highlighting both through his acts and art that we can not wait with our arms crossed for others to implement change. At the same time, Banksy is becoming a symbol of what movements driven by young people around the world are so desperately fighting for as we are seeing in the case of BLM for social justice or Extinction Rebellion for climate action. And the common denominator between all of these causes is that they are sending the needed message that governments will finally have to act according to the people’s requests if enough individuals demand change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The immigration crisis has become a challenge that we face as a collective and global society aggravated by the lack of international cooperation and specific guidelines to address the complexities that come with it. Just last year, more than 110,000 migrants attempted to reach Europe, with at least 1,200 deaths reported according to the International Organization for Migration <a href=\"https://www.iom.int/news/iom-mediterranean-arrivals-reach-110699-2019-deaths-reach-1283-world-deaths-fall\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">(IOM)</a>. Additionally, as 2020 continues to show us with a series of massive fires from Australia to the US, climate change is also threatening to displace many people from their homelands and this time underdeveloped nations will not be the only ones affected. It is, therefore, our collective responsibility to look not only for answers but to create a space in our societies to be inclusive of people with a different cultural background than our own.&nbsp; Perhaps it’s precisely this that Banksy is trying to convey through his art and even his secret identity, showing that every individual is worthy of fundamental human rights regardless of nationality or race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are certainly many unanswered questions surrounding the crisis, it is also true that many countries often turn a blind eye to plausible solutions, such as the implementation of quotas that can be tailored to each country´s economic situation, income per capita or even extension. A policy that could not only alleviate the economic burden of immigrants but could also soften some of the tension that often comes with blending two different cultures together, an issue that has proven catastrophic when not addressed properly, such as in the case of the emergence of neo-nazi parties in Germany as a response to the high intake of Syrian refugees. At the same time, in the case of Banksy’s boat, EU authorities were deliberately ignoring emergency policies under international law that aim to support immigrants in critical conditions. The EU is an organisation that above all fosters integration, solidarity and inclusivity and they should live up to those preaches. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter the cost or challenges faced with migration, there is no doubt Banksy has made us all ask ourselves: what would we want other people to do if it were us on that boat? More importantly, Banksy is also a symbol of what younger generations are repeatedly standing for: equality, freedom and justice and the added value of his anonymity is perhaps that anyone could be a Banksy, anyone can be a voice for those whose prayers are unheard.  Perhaps the world could use another Banksy or two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/ainamartinez/\">By Aina Martinez</a></em></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/ainamartinez/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/71c34ef84ddac013aea4b21b9c3410f0?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Aina Martinez\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/ainamartinez/\">Aina Martinez</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Anyone who has read Yuval Harari’s book ‘Sapiens’ will be acquainted with the idea of humans as hunter-gatherers. It was when we were our most prolific and when we were at our most intense state of happiness. Since then, global satisfaction has been on the decline. But why? Surely with all our new inventions we should be lazier, happier and more content than ever? But somehow, through our connection with the digital age and our ever growing relationship with the iPhone, we have lost the most important link in the happiness chain. The connection humans should have with nature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the global pandemic has had more negative airtime than most celebrities, there is at least a silver lining to the virus’s dark cloud. Months of lockdown, staycations, reduced travel and ever-growing social restrictions might seem like something out of a dystopian novel. But what many people have overlooked is what the virus has done to our minds. Pre-lockdown, the world was constantly sipping red bull, without a moment to sit down, headphones in the ears, with music, podcasts or phone calls. Anxiety had never been more prevalent, and with FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) being heightened by the small multi-coloured rings that pop up on Instagram, people cannot escape the feeling they need to be doing something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lockdown may not have benefitted the government, or anything man-made for that matter, but what the months at home have taught us it to slow down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was after seeing an advert for a new Francis Bacon exhibition at the Royal Academy that the epiphany hit. Bacon is famously known for his figurative paintings and disfigurement of the human body. The exhibition explores how many of Bacon’s inspirations came from his travels to South Africa and his study of the animals there. Bacon connects the human form to nature, reminding us of the part we play in the animal kingdom. In many ways, the coronavirus has highlighted the same thing. Not only has the planet shown us what it can do once we slow down, but there are so many areas where many have realised that they were living in brutal excess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without air miles, road miles and general human movement nature has been able to blossom, murky seas have become crystal clear. Lesser spotted wildlife has finally been spotted, and often by local inhabitants, not wildlife journalists on the prowl. Though, with this change people have begun to appreciate the intricate details of the places we live. We have Covid-19 to thank for this, one of the small benefits of the otherwise brutal global pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The virus has not only helped out the environment but, in many ways, it has helped humans as a race; childbirth and pregnancy. Usually, pregnancy is not a hinderance to the modern woman. She might have a bump, but she is still going to work, taking yoga classes and also finding time to walk the dog. Incredible. But many pregnant women have found being forced to sit down and relax has done wonders for their pregnancy, as well as their post-natal health. Having time to bond with their child has allowed women to feel more connected to their child, rather than returning to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there is the cessation of the social affair. Well, there is, of course, two sides to every story and while there are elements of the pandemic which have caused stress, many have found comfort in being able to switch off. Humans do not like change, we are built to enjoy routine and when stripped of that routine then we find ourselves in a scary position. However, the lack of social pressure has perhaps helped people in ways they may not have noticed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three months of not socialising. No coffee dates, spontaneous lunches or pints after work. It sounds horrendous, but do we socialise too much?</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the age of social media, three months without face to face contact was very normal, and social gatherings were often arranged months in advance, by that old chestnut, the post box. Today, however, we pack out weeks filled with as much as possible. Bailing last minute as you may have oversubscribed because contact is easy, and life is hectic. But when you remove the constant struggle to feel validated for socialising and having something to do, people have been able to relish their evenings, and appreciate their surroundings. As a result, people realise they do not need to always be on the move. Friends are not going anywhere. They also realised constant interaction leads to less fulfilling conversation. Socialising became a luxury which people began to respect. Nobody like us – the consumerist nation we have become – knows how to trim the excess out of our life. As Socrates famously pointed out all the way back in the BC years, ‘the secret to happiness is not found in seeking more, but in developing the capacity to enjoy less.’</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/ionalowe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">By Iona Lowe</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/ionalowe/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b00f37961397c832573126ce51c681f2?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Iona Lowe\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/ionalowe/\">Iona Lowe</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

What do you see? A society like the one we have now… or a better one? One that listens, one that seems interested in improving and not condemning? A place of hope and forgiveness, cherishing mistakes as they pave the way to change. A void of acceptance where people can speak without fear of judgement. Can you imagine that, just for a moment? No, me neither.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that doesn’t mean it cannot be. Our perspective is vital in this as with perspective comes action. A shift in thought could have the biggest change of all but perhaps it is the hardest to shake. How does one even measure perspective? It is easy to talk philosophically without any productive meaning so let’s confirm the context. Back in June, I went to London and marched in the BLM protests. In the middle of lockdown I put myself at risk and also those I was living with which was seen by some as selfish. The decision for me was a simple one as the personal guilt and sadness overweighed any other opinion that might have mattered before. On returning, I read an article that broke my heart. The writer, in short, condemned my generation for fighting the injustice to the point at which he said, ‘how can a generation expect to fight injustice when they cannot even clean their own room.’</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;There is indeed psychological research that suggests making your bed in the morning will help your mindset for the rest of that day.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the specifics here are not relevant to my argument. People of all ages clean their room and others, of all ages, decide not to. There is indeed psychological research that suggests making your bed in the morning will help your mindset for the rest of that day. This is neither here nor there. What upset me was their passive ignorance and utter rejection of a group of people trying to do the right thing. The article mentioned the problem of protesting – nothing but a lot of voices shouting with no embedded solution. This again is accurate in some regard, but we can see peaceful protesting as the forming of a solution; one must recognise the problem before one unveils a solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A person must also mourn. When a young man’s dying face is spread worldwide in the space of twelve hours there leaves little control to what happens afterwards. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/30/hundreds-join-march-to-protest-against-systemic-racism-in-the-uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BLM</a> protests in this country felt like a funeral. To personally show respect to the lives subjected to systemic inequality and to mourn those that lost their life to it is a person’s right. It is also a right to do this without being subjected to judgement. It doesn’t seem a big ask. So, why, in this generation particularly, does it seem we cannot step outside the boundaries of expectation and ask for change without experiencing commendation from above as if we are the problem?</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My own response to this article was – after some outward ranting to my laptop – kindness. This is what we must encourage together. Understandably, kindness is difficult to master absolutely, especially when some people seem to be set on offending, upsetting and belittling the good ones. Perhaps it is the new trend to be cold-hearted. The sad fact, however, is we need everyone on board for change to happen and the first step to this is patient understanding. There appears a sequence of fighting hate with hate, particularly online, which has birthed the mindset that opinion outweighs kindness. This is the crux of the problem and when we multiply this by the mass of content experienced everyday it feels we have become a washing machine of information that never ends, it just gets wetter, heavier and utterly misshapen until all the clothes are one colour and there is no truth to be found.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you were the laundry that had to detach this mass of clothes, how would you go about it? Would you take scissors and cut away until everything is broken, a frayed mess of sopping shirts and pockets? And then refund your customers, and tell them the washing machine broke, there was no way back for their beloved pair of socks their dead grandpa left them? Or would you slowly thread away the zips from the ties and unravel the sleeves until everything is whole again?

I myself am no Jesus Christ reincarnation. It is also easy to agree with this and then go about the day to day life of opinion over kindness. As humans, we are particularly flawed to repeat mistakes with the hope the outcome will be different. This is the first sign of madness. Well, we are mad. We are all absolutely mad. But let’s shift that perspective to hopeful madness and see where that gets us. Small steps will win the race, but if you act gently, with compassion and truth, you won’t have to compete at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/ellieskelton/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">By Ellie Skelton</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/ellieskelton/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/028de01a10df7ddcf7ac85dbd16be538?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Ellie Skelton\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/ellieskelton/\">Ellie Skelton</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

I always find it interesting (and somewhat amusing) when new measures come into place, not because of the restrictions that my life now faces, but because of some of the ridiculous comments that are made online. There’s two types of people online that spark my interest the most; The Karen’s who have to enlighten everyone on their outrageous views via Facebook and those who have most likely never voted before, but still get a bee in their bonnet whenever BoJo’s shambolic government makes a decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>From all walks of life come the “they have no idea what they’re doing” comments, which is true for the most part, but I think that things could be a lot worse, and not being able to have six other people in your house is hardly an infringement of your civil liberties. Another comment that made me smirk was that this is nothing but a “dictatorial government trying to control our society” which is just downright ridiculous. I swear that some people want to live in a dystopia that badly that they’ll just imagine that they’re living in one regardless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others read along the lines of, “If this was actually a pandemic the change of rules would be implemented immediately. This is a psychological operation designed to control us” (yes this is an actual comment), and I can’t see this as anything other than click bait. To deny that the pandemic is happening is a massive slap in the face for all of our front line NHS workers who are struggling daily. Equally, you need to give people time to digest the news of these new restrictions, as it can hardly be done on a day’s notice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My initial reaction to the news was, “I’m not sure that I have six friends to have over anyway”, and whilst I recognise the inconvenience of such a measure being reinstated, I think people are blindsiding the point of it, i.e. keeping the vulnerable safe. Once again, personal outrage is overtaking common sense. It seems to me that the sweeping trend across comment sections is that we have to accept that people will die, like they did with the Spanish Flu, but why should we? The issue I have with some people is the same issue that people had with the government, and that issue is of personal accountability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has become obvious that Covid has become a statistical problem rather than a moral one. People have become desensitised to the news, and the issue now is of people not caring anymore and putting others at risk. I saw a comment earlier that essentially puts the blame on those who are vulnerable by saying “why does the economy have to go into shit because of a few diabetics and old people”, and all I want to say about this is that some people are just horrible, and that’s one thing that this pandemic has made even more obvious.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;As for the people who are saying that the rules are too confusing, let’s be honest, it’s hardly like trying to crack the Davinci Code.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I admit that I haven’t been an angel all the time when it comes to social distancing (we are all human after all), but there’s some people who just couldn’t give a shit. This has become apparent at work, as well as on nights out where smoking areas are like the Wild West and track and trace is non-existent. This one comment, “Covid doesn’t effect places with tills in obviously” made me laugh especially, and not just for the poor use of grammar and spelling. Now, I work in retail and the social distancing measures are a bit of a joke as it is, but that’s made more stressful by people who are simply ignoring the use of masks, or who are wrongfully using the asthma card to get out of wearing a mask all together, or who feel as though they need their whole posse with them to get a new pair of 95’s. Last week I saw someone take six fake puffs of an inhaler as he walked into the store, and I just looked on in astonishment thinking “is wearing a mask really that bad?”. What people need to understand is that for everyone’s financial security, shops need to stay open, but this won’t be a problem if people just stick to the guidelines. As for the people who are saying that the rules are too confusing, let’s be honest, it’s hardly like trying to crack the Davinci Code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of these new measures, it is because of people assuming no personal accountability that they are coming back into place. Even with track and trace, I’ve heard countless people say that they’ve used a fake name or number for no reason other than because they can? I understand the idea of not wanting to put your personal information out there on a plate for the taking, but it’s for everyone’s own good. You may think you’re healthy, but you could still be a carrier and you can still put others at risk. It’s about reducing the spread by making small changes so that a nationwide lockdown can be avoided. Let’s not forget that we were told that social restrictions could be tightened if things started to get worse, which they clearly are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, I feel as though people need to gain a bit more perspective as to what is actually happening. This blame game is gaining frightening momentum, when all that is needed instead is a bit more ownership over one&#8217;s own actions.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/jamesmerrington/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">By James Merrington </a></em></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/jamesmerrington/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/03327dbffc8918dbdd4260cf05f0ba40?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"James Merrington\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/jamesmerrington/\">James Merrington</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

There’s a universally shared thrill in feeling like you’ve somehow cheated the system by snagging an extra, completely free, sausage roll (guilty). Similarly, joy may be found reaping the benefits of Caffè Nero’s app glitch (again, guilty &#8211; but I highly doubt the lack of my £2.60 will make a substantial dent in their off-shore accounts). Ah yes, we do all love a freebie, be it free food, free drinks, free haircuts or free speech. I would like to add a disclaimer here that the irony of having an opinion about how people express their opinions has not been lost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Definitions vary, but to avoid the risk of being pedantic and boring, some will argue I’m already guilty of these vices, the general consensus regarding freedom of expression is that you have a right to hold your opinions and express them freely without government interference. <strong>Article 10</strong> of <strong>The</strong> <strong>Human Rights Act</strong> states that an individual possesses the right to express such views via published articles, books, leaflets, television or radio-broadcasting, works of art and, last but certainly not least, the internet and social media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To use the classic adage: opinions are like arseholes; everyone has one and most of them stink. I’m paraphrasing here, but some are also hairier than others. There are many variables, no doubt, which I’ll leave to your imagination as this is not&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;kind of article&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I digress. The point is: we are all entitled to our opinions… unless. Unless yours differs from mine. It is no longer just the motley-crew of middle-aged aunts that offer up realms and realms of unsolicited opinions on their Facebook page. This is, of course, a sweeping generalisation but if you know, you know. These unrequested insights range anywhere from the classic Anyone-Who-Doesn’t-Share-This-Post-Doesn’t-Care-About-The-Donkeys, Share-If-you-Agree to the more pressing conservations surrounding the current political climate. Owing to this modern age we live in, everyone and anyone with access to the internet can share, offer, criticise, endorse, judge, impose, slander, rate and scrutinise opinions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the world navigates its way through a global pandemic, incidents of police brutality racial tensions and border crises, an increase in voices, expressions and opinions is rightly and justly inevitable. Less inevitable, though, is the hatred, contempt and vitriol directed at others who show signs of straying from the status quo. Insults, assumptions and misinterpretations are so brazenly thrown around the walls of social media. At this, I can’t help but despair. The energy from this tirade could instead be harnessed and channelled into action about the issues in question.  Instead of mindlessly posting and sharing for the sake of saving face and then admonishing friends who don’t follow suit, have a word with yourself. Educate yourself, engage with others in a meaningful conversation – realise you can learn some of the most valuable insights from those who disagree with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other side of all the noise of social media are those not willing to be subject to scrutiny. Instead, these individuals are resigned to a silent and meek URL existence. It is safer, encouraged almost, to stick to the cosy realms of “TBT!” and pictures of the family dog. The minefield of Twitter, Instagram and Facebook are best avoided. Yet, those in this camp incur a cost too: the charge of appearing blasé and indifferent when it comes to current affairs. Many of my peers, IRL, fall into the following categories: a) far from shy and retiring types or b) far from shy and retiring types, after a pint or seven. Assumed to be apolitical, indifferent or dispassionate, this seems better than the alternative. The social media sharks are continually circling below, waiting for their prey to make a blunder. Society’s increasing obsession with consistently <em>being right </em>and being <em>seen</em> to be saying the <em>right thing</em> intimidates many of us into merely remaining silent. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Large corporations are not exempt from online intimation either. There is a colossal pressure for businesses to not only act but <em>react </em>to certain situations, to always censor their content, ambassadors and employees. Whilst some issues, such as fundamental human rights, are never up for debate, I wonder if it is fair to continually superimpose ideals onto influencers and public figures, for them to regurgitate back to the consumer. Take the example of influencer Grace Beverley (formerly known as @gracefituk). Despite a net worth of over a million, named as one of Forbes&#8217; 30 under 30, she comes across as very relatable and down-to-earth. Recently, she was inundated with angry messages from her followers, demanding to know why she had not yet spoken out about issues X, Y, &amp; Z. They argued that in her position as an influencer, she must do so. She responded that she had been making dinner and had not seen the news. My question to the angry online mob: if you are <em>already aware</em> that X, Y, Z is immoral and should not be happening, then why are you so insistent on being assured X, Y, Z is immoral and should not be happening by <em>someone else?</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are numerous reasons as to why public figures do or do not speak out about a topic. Perhaps they are in the bath, saving the economy with their Wagamamas order (cheers, Rishi) or getting a free flat white. Radio or, in this case, internet silence does not necessarily equate to a silent mind or a lack of opinion. Sometimes, we all just need to take a day off, sit back and log off.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/lucysummerton/\">By Lucy Summerton</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Please give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/lucysummerton/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e211ae2b8a4f7756ff4971bc6bec5e81?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Lucy Summerton\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/lucysummerton/\">Lucy Summerton</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

The series follows Arabella, a working-class black woman, on her journey to understand and process her experience of sexual assault, whilst simultaneously refusing to let it define her identity. Through the various characters in the series, Coel delves deep into how sexuality, race, class and gender can intersect, and how this manifests in everyday life. What makes <em>I May Destroy You </em>so beautifully unique is how nearly all the cast members are black and yet the narrative is not <em>entirely</em> centred on race. Of course, it is still about race – but it is about so much more than that issue alone. Coel, in giving her characters the space to navigate and explore more than one axis of their identity at a time, revolutionises the way in which the black British experience is depicted on TV. She portrays race to be a part, but not the defining feature of, the character’s identities, highlighting the multifaceted and nuanced nature of the black British experience. Coel’s unique and intricate depiction of sexual trauma, which is based on her own real-life experience, is so raw and honest that throughout the course of the 12-episodes it feels as though we join Arabella on her journey to self-actualisation. <em>I May Destroy You </em>is both unsettling and heart-breaking, witty and hilarious, whilst being completely transformative and educational.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The show begins with Arabella struggling to find inspiration and motivation to write her second novel, so she takes a break by going out with some friends in London. However, this night ends up with Arabella finding herself abandoned and confused at a bar, with no recollection of the events that led her there. We later learn that on the night out Arabella was spiked and sexually assaulted. Over the series, and with the help of her best friends Terry (Weruche Opia) and Kwame (Paapa Essiedu), Arabella attempts to both discover, and come to terms with, what happened to her that evening.  Coel offers a refreshing exploration into how consent is defined, with each character becoming a victim of precarious sexual encounters, all of which spark an important conversation surrounding the nature of consent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following her sexual assault Arabella meets a man called Zain, a seemingly likeable character that appears to care for her, who she then enters a consensual sexual relationship with. However, in the middle of their consensual sex, he takes the condom off without her knowing. It’s an unnerving scene to watch, as Arabella is initially distressed and confused as to why she has been misled, but quickly becomes preoccupied with getting the morning after pill. However, as time progresses, she becomes increasingly uncomfortable with the situation that Zain put her in, but she does not have the language to articulate what has actually happened to her. It isn’t until she asks a police officer in charge of her case about non-consensual condom removal that she, and I’m sure many of the audience – myself included, discovered that it is far from just a morally dubious and deceitful act, it is actually a form of sexual assault known as ‘stealthing’. Stealthing is such a perfect example of one of the many underrepresented and widely misunderstood ways in which a person’s consent can be violated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, Kwame, who Arabella and Terry call the ‘king of Grindr’ is an overtly sexual man, yet he is still just as susceptible to abuse as his female counterparts. After a Grindr hook-up, Kwame goes to leave, but has the door violently slammed in front of him and ends up being a victim of non-penetrative sexual assault. Here Coel confronts some common misconceptions surrounding sexual assault; sexual assault is not exclusive to women, and yes you can enthusiastically consent to having sex with someone once AND refuse consent later on. The stigmatisation of male rape victims is highlighted in the dichotomy between the way in which the police react to Arabella’s case compared to Kwame. After mustering up the courage to report this incident to the police, the blatantly homophobic officer refuses to take his testimony seriously. Kwame subsequently embarks on his own journey, alongside Arabella’s, to come to terms with what happened to him and to speak openly about it with his friends. In this scene Coel challenges the taboo surrounding male sexual assault victims by writing Kwame’s story into the narrative – assault and the subsequent trauma can equally affect all genders and sexualities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coel explores the many ways in which consent and people’s boundaries can be violated – both clear-cut and subtle. In Rome, Terry has a threesome with two men that she had met that evening. However, as she watches them leave from the window, she discovers that they knew each other prior to the threesome, and had planned and orchestrated the entire thing. Inevitably, Terry is left feeling manipulated and unsettled by the event, as these men had lied to make her feel as though she was in control of the situation. These more subtle incidences of coercion and violations of consent, challenge the widely held belief that a rapist is always an inherently ‘evil’ human, and that assault is always in a violent and forceful context. Coel expands society’s understanding of the nature of sexual assault, showing us that it is not always as binary as we may have previously thought. Instead, we are encouraged to reassess and re-examine our ideas of consent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this fascinating exploration into the nature of consent, Coel navigates complex topics with so much sensitivity, challenging our conceptions and misconceptions of what it means to be sexually assaulted. Consent isn’t a binary, it isn’t as simple or clear as a ‘yes’ or ‘no’, it is multi-layered and nuanced and needs much more discussion and consideration than we currently give it. <em>I May Destroy You </em>has paved the way for a much more sophisticated and informed conversation surrounding what constitutes consent, and is a series that everyone, especially men, can learn so much from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Sophie Rumble </em></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If you or someone close to you has been affected by sexual abuse, below are some support lines:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Rape Crisis<br>Helpline: 0808 802 9999 (12-2:30 and 7-9:30)<br><a href=\"http://www.rapecrisis.org.uk/\">Rapecrisis.org.uk</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">The Survivors Trust<br>Helpline: 0808 801 0818<br><a href=\"http://www.thesurvivorstrust.org/\">Thesurvivorstrust.org</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>For Men</strong><br>Survivors UK – Male Rape and Sexual Abuse Support<br><a href=\"http://www.survivorsuk.org/\">Survivorsuk.org</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>For members of the LGBT community<br></strong>Galop<br><a href=\"http://www.galop.org.uk/\">Galop.org</a></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/sophierumble/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/64b8c89e61b0d4387420b809464551ee?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Sophie Rumble\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/sophierumble/\">Sophie Rumble</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

As the lights erupt and the Christmas spirit envelops the nation, it truly is a special time of year. However, it makes me value the importance of family and the sanctity of life for a very different reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Boxing Day 2004, the deadliest natural disaster in recent history wreaked havoc across South-East Asia, claiming the lives of 230,000 innocent people. As I approach my 23rd Christmas, midway through my 5th year of Medical School, contemplating career choices and planning New Year’s parties, I pause for a moment to appreciate how phenomenally lucky I am to still be here today. On Boxing Day 2004, I was in Galle, Sri Lanka, one of the cities worst affected by the tsunami. This is my story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having moved from Sri Lanka to the UK in 2002, I had always enjoyed going back during the holidays to visit my family and friends. In 2004, my elder brother, my mum and I travelled to Sri Lanka for a 3-week holiday spanning Christmas and the New Year. My dad was tied down at work and had to stay home in Norwich.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Boxing Day 2004, I was woken up at 6 am by my mum. We were in my uncle’s house in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Once I got through the initial confusion of being woken up so early, I was overcome with excitement. We had planned to go on a two-day trip to a coastal town on the south coast called Tissa. This meant pools, beaches and ball games — what more could an 8-year-old want? The travelling party consisted of my brother, mum, two cousins, aunt, uncle and myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/12.jpg?resize=499%2C317&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1873\" width=\"499\" height=\"317\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/12.jpg?w=478&amp;ssl=1 478w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/12.jpg?resize=300%2C190&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We travelled along the south-west coast – world-famous for its golden beaches, exuberant marine life and surfing opportunities. I watched inquisitively as the fishermen brought in their morning’s catch, little did I realise that, for many of them, this would be their last day’s work. At around 9 am, we took a pit stop in Galle, one of the largest cities in the south of Sri Lanka. Galle is a bustling place embellished with a giant 16th century fort, overlooking the Galle International Cricket Stadium. We parked the van outside ‘Food City’, a supermarket much like Sainsbury’s or Tesco, as my mum wanted to get some snacks for the rest of the journey. Initially, my mum was going to go with my uncle, leaving me in the van with my brother and cousins. However, she then said something that, in hindsight, saved my life:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Lasith are you coming? You can get some chocolate biscuits.”</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a somewhat rotund 8- year-old with an insatiable sweet tooth, this was an offer that I could not resist. I jumped out of the van and eagerly waddled up the stairs with my mum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We entered the 2nd floor of the supermarket with only one thing on my mind: ‘CHOCOLATE BISCUITS!’. I weaved in and out of the aisles like a hyperactive Pac-Man until I found my target. I was stood in front of the biscuits aisle, expertly perusing the range, when I heard my mum screaming. I ran towards her, she was stood in front of a large glass window, and I was shocked by what I saw. The city of Galle was submerged in 15 feet of dark, violent sea water. Innocent people were being thrown around like rag dolls. Buses, cars and tuk-tuks were being flung into buildings as if they were weightless toys. Amidst this chaos, I saw something even more terrifying. Our van, with the scrambling silhouettes of my brother, cousins and aunt inside, was being battered by the waves before being completely submerged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, the gravity of the situation became apparent.&nbsp;<em>‘This is serious, people are dying around me, my brother might die’</em>&nbsp;lapped through my head, each cycle exacerbating my hysteria. We watched helplessly as people tried to clamber up buildings to get to safety, only to be mercilessly swatted away by the waves. As time went on, the hysteria transformed into frank consideration of how my life would be without my brother — thoughts that are beyond the usual remit of an 8-year-old. ‘We will never play cricket together again, he’ll never see me go to university, I’ll never see him get married’ — each simulation of his absence making it progressively harder for me to breathe or think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My uncle was in a particularly bad state. His entire family was in the water, unaccounted for. He made the courageous decision (arguably, his only option) to enter the water to search for his family. My mum and I remained in Food City, praying to Gods we didn’t routinely believe in to perform a miracle on our behalf. I specifically remember bargaining with non-specific supernatural powers, explaining that I will strain every sinew for the rest of my life to make a positive difference to this world, if I could only have my brother back in return.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The city was enveloped in pain and misery — the cries of newly and reluctantly appointed widows, widowers and orphans, flooding every nook and cranny. A second and third wave had struck the city, deepening wounds and quashing hope. Then, 4 hours after the ordeal began, our prayers were answered. A soldier, who had been called to the city at this time of crisis, came to me and my mum, and told us that my brother was safe, and had been taken to the house of a local family on high ground. He was with my two cousins. My mum and I were overcome by an intense feeling of relief. All those piercing thoughts that were tormenting me will, thankfully, never enter the realm of reality. We were then escorted by the soldiers and reunited with my brother.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once our emotions were finally under control, my brother told us of his experience. As the water started sweeping the van down the streets of Galle and the possibility of drowning became very real, my brother smashed the window and they all crawled out. At this point, the powerful torrents separated them. My brother got entangled underwater in a web of fallen telephone cables, causing a large laceration on his back. He managed to wriggle out only to be swept towards a canal running through the city. The canal was a particularly dangerous area — vehicles, rubble and people were being sucked in as if it were a black hole. If you were swept into the canal, that was it. My brother was pushed treacherously close, however, he managed to hoist himself onto a tree by the side of the canal. One of my cousins, similarly, grabbed onto a tree trunk whilst the other drifted close enough to my brother, such that he could pull her up onto the tree. Once the waters had calmed, they were taken to safety at a nearby church. My aunt had been swept over a kilometre before latching onto a fence and being taken to safety.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/123.jpg?resize=510%2C306&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1872\" width=\"510\" height=\"306\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/123.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=510%2C306&amp;ssl=1 1020w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/123.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=510%2C306&amp;ssl=1 1530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather unexpectedly, my uncle, who entered the water after the first wave had struck, was the worst injured. He had badly cut his foot and lost a lot of blood. He was found unconscious and taken to a local doctor who managed to dress his wound and resuscitate him. In the evening, once the water had receded for the last time, we were taken by an army convoy to pick up my uncle and head back to Colombo. Thanks to the time difference, my dad was fast asleep whilst all of this unfolded. As he unassumingly switched on BBC news in the morning, he was met with ghastly images of apocalyptic destruction with mounting death tolls in South Asia. Fortunately, by the time he called us, we were all safe and sound. Reflecting upon this experience churns an eclectic collection of emotions. The intense feelings of potential loss that burdened me that day are juxtaposed by the elation that we survived against all odds. My mum and I had been in Food City for no more than 5 minutes before the tsunami struck. We were intending to be in there for no more than 5 minutes. Therefore, if the tsunami had struck 6 minutes earlier or 6 minutes later, our van may have been on the road in thick traffic, vulnerable to the mighty power of the sea. 6 minutes, and the outcome could have been very, very different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every so often I stop to think about the 230,000 lives that were lost and the many millions of lives that were irreparably destroyed that day. If not for a very fine margin, my family could have contributed to that total. As we live our pleasant lives in London we may complain about coursework, exams, relationships and all sorts — when the going is (relatively) easy we often find something (relatively) petty to pin our dissatisfaction on. It’s almost as if humans have an in-built dissatisfaction quota that must be fulfilled and it is often allocated to the least pleasing thing in our lives at the time. I’m not trying to undermine issues ‘lesser’ in magnitude than a natural disaster — these problems are, of course, of utmost importance to the individual who suffers them. However, every now and then, I feel it’s important to take a step back and be humbled by the fragility of human life and appreciate how phenomenally fortunate we are to be alive and have the capability to make a positive difference to the world, no matter how big or small that may be. Today, embrace your family and friends, place your worries in the backseat for just a moment, and spend some time counting your blessings.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>By <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/lasithranasinghe/\">Lasith Ranasinghe</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/lasithranasinghe/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4816fcc8e0736188cd9fd7d6a3c3cc07?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Lasith P Ranasinghe\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/lasithranasinghe/\">Lasith P Ranasinghe</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Photograph credit: StoryBlocks</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-cyan-bluish-gray-color is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Some fight ageing with every fibre of their being, whilst others have recently decided to trade their natural looks for the new sweeping beauty aesthetic, the ‘Instagram face’.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of your viewpoint, age inevitably and naturally affects us all. We <strong>all</strong> age. This is an inescapable reality and fact that we have to live with and make peace with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Society has taught us all to look at the fine lines on our face, fading youthfulness and grey hairs, tempting us with the best new skincare products, hair dye or night cream. This vicious cycle tends to be aimed more at women opposed to their male counterparts; targeting teenage girls, using their vulnerability and social anxieties to shape and encourage them to become solely focused on their outward appearances. In essence, to ensure teenage girls continuously buy their products. With promises of youthfulness and self-confidence with these products the beauty industry has become, according to a recent report from the retail analytics firm Edited, a $532 billion industry which is on a rapid upward trajectory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Socially, the beauty and cosmetic industry has always thrived on issues concerning women’s ageing; the emphasis usually on equating less wrinkles with a promised increase in happiness and self-esteem… essentially, selling more products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has led to increasing stress amongst women trapped in the cycle of equating success with a youthful appearance; ultimately basing self-worth exclusively on your looks is unrealistic and unattainable. In contrast to women, biologically the male gaze tends to be based on age. Studies show that men tend to find the peak attractiveness of women to be restricted from late teen to early twenties. Yet, the same study showed men’s attractiveness to women was not reduced to a few years but stayed consistent as they grew older together. Could the perception of wrinkled men in the media as more ‘mature’, more ‘experienced’, ‘growing sexier with age’ be to blame? In contrast, women of ages 16-25 are what the media and modelling agencies heavily rely on. This further enforces greater pressure on women to retain their teenage looks throughout their thirties, forties and even fifties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, is the gracefulness of ageing constricted to <em>gender</em>? Unfortunately, in the media this tends to be the case. As women age, they become <strong>haggard</strong>. As men age, they become <strong>dignified</strong>…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Men’s increase in age seems to go hand-in-hand with an excel in career. With their multiplying wrinkles comes a growth in respect, money, and applause. Women’s grotesque ageing signs, however, proves enough to signify their expiration date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Miriam O’Reilly, ex-tv presenter of Country-file, admitted BBC producers offered her black hair dye to cover up her grey roots. She subsequently went on to win a case against them for age discrimination. This was also the case for BBC newsreader Fiona Bruce, who previously announced, “I don’t want my grey hairs to show whilst I’m reading the news.” Therefore, Bruce’s hair dye is a career <em>essential</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“There comes a point &#8211; especially if you’re a woman &#8211; when your career just falls off a cliff.”</p><cite><br>Fiona Bruce, BBC1 Newsreader, 2012 interview</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Endlessly being forced to search for past youthfulness – Botox, ageing creams, fitness regimes and dietary supplements are what colours their identity. Women are desperately being sold this idea that youthful appearance will bring validation and security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In today’s population of young women, the effects of ageism and scrutinised outward image is clearly taking its toll. One of the most influential social media icons has landmarked what Instagram has become today, helping to brand the new term ‘Instagram face’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new wave of beauty culture has formed from the growing influence of beauty bloggers and<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"477\" height=\"363\" src=\"\"> reality TV stars. However, the typical ‘Instagram face’ can be mostly credited to reality star, social media influencer and cosmetics line owner, Kylie Jenner.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-1.png?resize=533%2C406&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1863\" width=\"533\" height=\"406\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-1.png?w=477&amp;ssl=1 477w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-1.png?resize=300%2C228&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><br><em>Travis Scott (left) and Kylie Jenner (right) pictured at the premiere of Scott’s ‘Look Mommy I Can Fly’, credit Getty Images</em><br></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This trend isn’t just assumption. Multiple studies have shown that women who are in their late teens and early twenties are already choosing non-surgical treatments to achieve the pristine non-wrinkled image of perfection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comparable social media influencers include the likes of reality star Megan Barton-Hanson from ITV’s <em>Love Island </em>as well as reality stars from MTV’s <em>Geordie Shore</em>: Holly Hagan, Charlotte Crosby, Marnie Simpson. Using their social media platforms as a source of income for paid advertisements, this social world is at the centre of their everyday lives. All of these stars have undergone nonsurgical treatments, bringing about a more widely accepted view of fillers from their millions of followers.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"434\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-2.png?resize=640%2C434&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1864\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-2.png?w=656&amp;ssl=1 656w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-2.png?resize=300%2C204&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><br><em>‘The Instagram face’ can be seen on Geordie Shore stars (from left to right): Marnie Simpson, Charlotte Crosby, Sophie Kasaei and Holly Hagan.

In a Channel 4 documentary that aired earlier this year, she stated that although cosmetic work “change[s] the outside shell,” ultimately “you’re still dealing with the insecurities and self-esteem issues as before…chucking money isn’t gonna fix that.” This demonstrates how fillers may eventually make us <em>more</em> insecure.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“I just don’t want girls to have unrealistic expectations like I did…it didn’t fix anything.”</p><cite><br>Megan Barton Hansen<em>, August 2019 Channel 4 Docs</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-3.png?resize=510%2C345&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1865\" width=\"510\" height=\"345\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><br><em>Megan Barton-Hanson’s transformation pictured left, credit: instagram</em><br></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In a 2002 interview, actress Meryl Streep voiced her concern over the constant prejudices against women in her industry: “the attention to how you look is cruel and unrealistic,” and subsequently women end up ‘devaluing themselves’. Although it is difficult to ignore the constant stream of consumeristic bombardment that particularly target ageing women, getting older should be embraced, not feared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, on the same footing there is a flipped perspective that you can choose to see. This is one where women are empowered and confident enough to take control of their own bodies and lifestyle decisions. If choosing to reduce the appearance of their wrinkles, slowing down the ageing process is their <em>own choice</em> – more power to them. In the current climate where women’s value is ranked by their body type, facial features or body hair decisions, women can choose to employ this to their advantage. By using the restrictions of the patriarchal male gaze to your advantage, this can be just as empowering. In performing an increased version of femininity whether that’s for yourself, your confidence, for increased level of basic respect by employers, job opportunities, men or even other women, that’s completely up to you and shouldn’t be judged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a quote I read recently that said, “When you’re feeling insecure about a particular body part, ask yourself who’s profiting off my insecurities?” This can usually distinguish whether the reason you feel insecure is legitimate or whether it’s just distorted idealism being sold to you from a company. You may realise you’re not actually insecure about yourself but being compelled to be. So, whatever decision you choose to make about your appearance in the future, ask yourself <em>why </em>you are making it. This can leave you feeling more empowered and confident about your choice, not more insecure. You may choose to tune out next time you see an influencer endorsing another beauty product or retract your attention from the next ageist advert. Or you may choose to use this vicious consumerist cycle to your own advantage, which can feel just as liberating as the latter.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/katiegibson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">By Katie Gibson</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/katiegibson/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a2e83111706c4a8341f0371a8511d5b?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Katie Gibson\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/katiegibson/\">Katie Gibson</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

This has meant that many people have missed their summer holidays; just another thing to add to the list of ‘things I couldn’t do because of Covid-19’. Yes, I’m very much aware this is a first world problem, but who doesn’t love a holibobs? Summer holidays are always something to look forward to; kids splashing around in the pool, oblivious to the world around them; teenagers learning their drinking limits; adults somehow getting some peace and quiet; and, of course, we can’t forget the older generation with their cruises!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What would’ve been another great summer if it weren’t for the pandemic set to include Glastonbury’s 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary, the Tokyo Olympics, and, high on everyone’s list, the Eurovision Song Contest 2020. If you are one of those who really did miss Eurovision this year, to fill that Graham Norton void, head over to Netflix and watch <em>Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga… </em>you’re welcome in advance for the song ‘Jaja Ding Dong’. Now that’s been plugged, lets continue. There is a zeitgeist across the nation of feeling hard done by because you’re missing out on your holidays, but then you feel bad about feeling hard done by because, compared with many people, you have it easy: the worst thing to happen is that you can’t go on your summer holiday. And so, the guilt cycle begins again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside the <em>potentially</em> selfish reasoning above for summer holidays, they are actually an essential part of many European countries’ income and therefore the lack of them will have  a huge impact on economies. In Spain, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e84ab92c-6e6a-43ef-9a67-36c3696be18d\">tourism accounts for 12 per cent</a> of gross domestic product and as much as 10 per cent of European economic activity depends on tourism. Tom Jenkins, the chief executive of the European Tourism Association, has said that “for the tourism industry itself, it’s worth risking a second wave just to get some revenues.” Something that many people might not agree with, but hey, it’s a dog-eat-dog world after all! If it was your business on the line, what would you do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After losing both Easter and May holidays, the hope of having at least some sort of revenue from the summer was crucial, and with the announcement of ‘travel corridors’ on July 10<sup>th</sup> this lifeline was possible. The announcement from the government stated that from the 10<sup>th</sup> Brits could travel abroad to any of the countries on their approved 59 destinations list without having to quarantine for two weeks on return. With this easing of rules and regulations and <em>actually</em> <em>being</em> <em>allowed</em> to travel, many people jumped at the opportunity to be able to go abroad and be anywhere that wasn’t their own home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guilty as charged, I was one of those people. In my defence, the flights had been booked at Christmas and had not yet been cancelled. So, if the flight was still going, there was no stopping me getting on that plane! I flew to Murcia, Spain on July 24<sup>th</sup> and throughout the whole process of leaving the country I did not once feel uncomfortable. Everyone wore masks in the airport, we had been called to board the plane in groups to avoid congestion, there was no food and drink offered on the journey, and we were only allowed to stand up from our seats and disembark the plane once the row in front of us had left – that was something which has immensely improved the experience of flying! I can confirm that no one misses the scramble to get up and peg it down to the other end of the plane because that was the only place where could fit your hand luggage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On arriving, I was so impressed with how the rules had been implemented and stuck to by Spanish citizens. The clarity around masks and what to do and what not to do was refreshing. Boris, <em>tome nota.</em> For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Masks to be worn entering restaurants but can be removed when sat down.</li><li>You must wear your mask at all times when walking around outside, or inside public places.</li><li>Masks must be worn walking onto and from the beach but may be removed when you’re settled in an area, likewise with swimming pools.</li><li>Shared pools were to be occupied only by those who were in the same household, if someone else was in there you would just have to wait your turn.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Who knew that unambiguity in Covid-19 rules could be possible?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, there is the obvious question: is it worth risking the possibility of getting the virus for a week’s holiday? Well, it’s really up to the individual. Countries need the tourists and their money in order to try and overcome the impending recession, but if you don’t feel comfortable about going then don’t do it – there are plenty of those who are willing to take the risk. We arrived in Spain the day they decided to impose a fourteen-day quarantine with no warning, which having just completed it I wouldn’t say it’s something to put you off going. However many days it is, as the cool kids would say: quarantine, we’ve got that on lock (down).</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/gracebrowne/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">By Grace Browne</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/gracebrowne/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/622838b9b746d1af45a38bffc7494910?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Grace Browne\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/gracebrowne/\">Grace Browne</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Teachers submitted predicted results which were then taken by the government to be used with a specially formulated algorithm to work out the final grade. This algorithm, devised by the regulator Ofqual, has shown to give substantial weight to the past performances of schools, which resulted in nearly 40% of marks being downgraded, in some cases, by more than one grade. Not the results day students were hoping for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Labour has said that this algorithm used to determine (or more truthfully, downgrade) the A level exam results has breached anti-discrimination legislation. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/aug/08/poorer-students-will-suffer-in-unfair-a-level-grading-model-uk-parents-warn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">“Ofqual is effectively tying in students to the performance of previous students at their school, which is no way a representation of an individual’s ability to do well,”</a> says Michael Bell, father of Lexie Bell, who was predicted A*AA but was incredibly worried about the use of the algorithm as in the last three years no candidate at her school has achieved above a C grade in her chosen subjects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many students who did not achieve their originally predicted grades on results day chose to go through clearing in order to be able to secure a place at university, even if it wasn’t at their first or second choice, and with a completely different course. This has meant that many courses have been filled simply through students panicking and accepting any offer they can get in the hope that they can start university this September. Fortunately, there are many universities who have said that they will honour all offers that they have made to students before and after the original results were announced, such as Worcester College, Oxford and Queen’s University, Belfast. This being said, there are still many students who have said that their places at such universities have since been withdrawn. In an attempt to open up space and help more students have the chance to study what they originally intended at university, Durham have promised to offer a bursary and a guarantee of accommodation to all students who defer their place until 2021. However, other universities don’t have this luxury and are struggling to accommodate those who still want to start in September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Protests up and down the country in response to this have shown just how much this algorithm has affected the lives of teenagers, with particular coverage showing protestors chanting “fuck the algorithm” outside England’s Department for Education. These protests, along with online petitions, caused the government to make a humiliating U-turn on Monday 17<sup>th</sup>August, less than two working days after the results were released, and stated that the students’ grades would be based solely off the teachers’ assessments. <em>Finally</em>. In light of the debacle, the temporary cap on the number of places that universities can offer has been lifted, but many students who have now got the grades they originally wanted still might struggle to be accepted on to their desired course due to those who have taken up places through clearing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This algorithm disaster has not only been a metaphorical display of the Tory government’s leadership abilities but has showcased the inequality that is ever so present in the education system. Data has suggested that fee-paying private schools disproportionately benefited from the algorithm, showing an increase of 4.7 percent in A grades, meanwhile state funded schools saw an increase of just 2 percent – less than half. The fact that students were discriminated upon solely based on their postcode is genuinely unfathomable. The algorithm has shown the fallacy of the meritocracy we claim to have in the UK – meritocracy meaning a social system, society, or organisation in which people get success or power because of their abilities, not because of their money or social position. This ‘meritocracy’ in the UK characterises education and attainment, but the algorithm has showcased the innate inequalities of the system that we often do not see due to occasional underdogs performing to higher standards than expected. In 2018, The Sutton Trust, who works to increase social mobility, conducted a study that showed that <a href=\"https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/08/14/alev-a14.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">60 percent of private school students in higher education go on to attend Russel Group universities contrasted</a> with less than a quarter of students from state comprehensive schools and six forms attending similar institutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This algorithm shouldn’t come as a shock as it has laid bare the severe problems of the education system which already exist: kids from good schools in affluent places go to good universities, and the algorithm has meant that the exceptions who would have got their grades despite more difficult social barriers have been made to conform to the typical stereotype of poor performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ofqual algorithm scandal has highlighted the fact that there is indeed an unfairness in education opportunities across the nation. But this algorithm has a different name, it’s called structural inequality.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Grace Browne</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Give the article a rating below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/gracebrowne/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/622838b9b746d1af45a38bffc7494910?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Grace Browne\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/gracebrowne/\">Grace Browne</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

With the introduction of extra safety precautions, temperature tests, quarantine and social distancing, one would assume that the film industry has pressed pause on filming and productions, in order to align with government regulations. However, Sam Levinson, director and creator of the hit show <em>Euphoria</em>, is the first to successfully shoot and produce a film during this pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Malcolm &amp; Marie </em>was filmed between 7<sup>th</sup> June and 2<sup>nd</sup> July at the Caterpillar House in California. Its 33 acres of land were completely quarantined for the duration of shooting, as the cast, crew, directors and even chefs were bound together for daily temperature checks and increased defences against the virus. The unfamiliar, yet optimistic setting for film making was all compliant with WGA, DGA, SAG_AFTRA approvals and COVID-19 safety protocols. Starring Zendaya and John David Williams, the plot of this ‘secret Corona film’ is still fairly under wraps but is rumoured to echo the modern-day theme of Netflix’s <em>Marriage Story</em>, whilst resonating a number of current global and social themes. Zendaya confirmed her involvement in the film by sharing a shot from the film on her Instagram and Twitter accounts, which encouraged mass support from other cinematic figures, including as director Ava DuVernay and actress Yara Shahidi. A release date is yet to be announced, however the rapid progression of production does bode well for those fervent film fanatics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With ‘pandemic friendly’ shooting and production adhered to, the financial backing and support of <em>Malcolm &amp; Marie </em>acts as evidence of those keen to support the art of filmmaking. With the safety of the film as a priority, the project was bankrolled entirely, throughout pre-production and production, by Levinson, his production partner and wife Ashley Levinson, producer Kevin Turen and leading cast members Washington and Zendaya. As a result of the past few months, one thing most people will now agree on is the importance and appreciation of the arts and entertainment industry, and better yet, how the importance its survival is. <em>Malcolm &amp; Marie </em>is carrying a curious amount of pressure for the mysterious possibilities of quarantined filmmaking. Regardless of its success in the box office, this film could certainly become symbolic for the filmmaking era. Have they succeeded in making the impossible possible?</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"506\" height=\"520\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/film-pic-1.png?resize=506%2C520&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1844\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/film-pic-1.png?w=506&amp;ssl=1 506w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/film-pic-1.png?resize=292%2C300&amp;ssl=1 292w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><em>Open-air cinema, Piazza Maggiore, Bologna</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, the real question is: is this the future of filmmaking? This template approach to the film industry could in fact be in place for the foreseeable future, or at least until it is safe to return to larger, more open sets. Cinema lovers have been swift to recognise that this places limitations on the potential for future films, with limited characters, locations and crews, franchises such as <em>Fast and Furious</em>, <em>Mission Impossible </em>and <em>James Bond </em>may face particular strain on their usual exotic sets. Additionally, filmmakers face the challenge of the inability to film in public spaces, everyone remaining on set until the end of shoot and even greater creativity required for high quality productions. For example, with <em>Malcolm &amp; Marie</em> there were rules including a maximum of 12 people on set at any time, which could significantly affect action films, where stunt doubles and additional crew members are all required. Perhaps the future of film will enter a more simplistic and acting focused era? Or maybe the Golden Era of Cinema might be topped by the Era of Coronavirus? Time will tell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following on from the potential hit that Covid-19 could pose on the future of travel in films, the internet was quick to jump to conclusions over rumours of Harry Styles reigniting his acting career and pairing up with Brad Pitt for an upcoming film. Despite the initial disappointment, whilst learning that Mr Styles was not returning to the big screen any time soon, I contemplated those challenges facing films with their settings cast across the globe. Internet rumours regarding the upcoming film <em>Faster, Cheaper, Better, </em>began after film distributor Vértice Cine, posted casting news for the project. The current synopsis, as per <a href=\"https://www.capitalfm.com/artists/harry-styles/brad-pitt-movie-faster-cheaper-better/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Capital FM</a>, reads &#8220;The film spans 20 years in multiple locations with intertwined stories of countless characters including: a union boss, a young businessman, an inland farm manager, and a tech millionaire whose lives are cut short when the automation and artificial intelligence transform the world as we know it. In the end, everyone must face the meaning of being human.&#8221; Regardless of the casting, and Harry Styles’ absence, the challenge that directors now face is whether or not they will in fact be able to bring their ideas to life for future projects. As we anticipate the ‘new normal’ (if there ever was such a thing) for the film industry, one can only hope that the likes of Harry Styles will return to the big screen and filmmaking can continue to thrive as an international platform for the arts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>©</strong>&nbsp;S R D HILL</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/sophiahill/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">By Sophia Hill</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/sophiahill/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/773e30cf9e40406f81ebd8cb25ada8cc?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Sophia Hill\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/sophiahill/\">Sophia Hill</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

The first was that no, I had not been dreaming, there really was a global pandemic threatening the lives of innocent people just outside my front door; and the second (albeit not as important but still up there) was that I was now on my own. And it was this realisation that caused me to curl up a little under my duvet. From that moment onwards I was the only one left in the house, the only one who decided to stay in our student house and not go home to the comfort of family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn’t too terrible at first. I kept myself busy, I had essays to write and research to read, I cleaned often and went for walks around the neighbourhood, I watched too much TV and even learnt how to make a paper crane. And yet, even with the seemingly endless dust gatherings that congregated behind the bathroom door and the regular video calls chatting to my friend and her cat, who I’m pretty sure doesn’t like me, I couldn’t help but feel like there was something missing. But then I remembered a podcast and my old friends Elis and John.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I listened to them constantly, almost religiously.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I hadn’t listened to their podcast, simply titled Elis James and John Robins, in a while so when I pressed play on their latest episode I immediately felt sense of nostalgia and comfort hit me. It was like catching up with old friends, even though time had passed and Covid-19 had disrupted present society, there was no awkwardness or mindless small talk as people tried to think of something more substantial to say. It was like nothing had changed. I listened to them constantly, almost religiously. I eagerly waited for new episodes and enjoyed listening to them as they played their made up games and spoke about random topics like service stations and kitchen appliances. The content they provided wasn’t exactly what you would call hard-hitting, and I have to admit some of the references that they made did go over my head (most of them about the early 90s and football players) but I didn’t care, as at that moment that’s what I needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lockdown seemed to be the only topic on everyone’s minds, and understandably so. No one really knew what was happening or when it would end. There were questions after questions with multiple sources providing different responses and of course people used each other to vent or explain their worries. I was definitely one of those people and even began to scare myself after I woke up one morning with a sore throat, which incidentally was just because I drank little water the day before. After some time, I needed a break from Covid-19 and that’s what Elis and John’s podcast gave me. Apparently I wasn’t the only one who felt this. According to <em>The Guardian</em> more people were turning to podcasts to help replace the social void present in their new homebound lives. They also suggested that with podcasts “one of the pleasures of the medium has always been its intimacy”, and it’s this intimacy that I realised I had been missing; more specifically, the intimacy involved in talking and listening to strangers. The feeling of being able to freely walk into a shop and discreetly listen to the couple behind in the queue as they decide on what to do in the evening or the feeling of sitting in a café and watching as people from all walks of life enter and order their usual. It’s a strange form of intimacy that I never really paid attention to. It made me understand that intimacy isn’t just about the physical side of things; it could also be about the familiar or closeness that one experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I lived on my own for two months. Like with anything, there were good days and there were bad days. But one thing that became a constant in my life was the podcast. It provided me with this sense of intimacy; this sense of closeness. Listening to people, who I had never met before, talk about their problems and laugh with each other over the mundane tasks they needed to do put my mind at ease a little. I began to see that I wasn’t the only one experiencing these highs and lows during such a strange and uncertain time. And I can confidently say that I don’t feel I wasted any time in listening to their podcast so much, in fact I even learned a few new things. For example, did anyone else know that the dial on a toaster is time and not heat? Because I didn’t, and to this day I am still surprised by this. But maybe that’s why I found so much comfort in this podcast. Maybe it’s good to have other voices in your life to help you discover new things or maybe to help you forget things, even if it’s only for an hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/shivanimistry/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">By Shivani Mistry</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/shivanimistry/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f1199b3d2e39d1d97f02e1824ad0c252?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Shivani Mistry\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/shivanimistry/\">Shivani Mistry</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

And no, I’m not talking about Donald Trump’s response to Michelle Obama that he would not be in office if it weren’t for the failing of her husband’s administration: we’re trying to ignore that one. I’m talking about Joe Biden, the Democratic Presidential Nominee announcing that as well as pledging to appoint a Black woman to the Supreme Court, has now announced Senator Kamala Harris (pronounced “comma-lah”) to be his running mate for Vice President. Kamala Harris, who has defined her political career around her campaigns for justice, will be the first African-American woman and first person of Asian descent to be nominated as VP. With Biden saying throughout his campaign that he is just a “transitional” figure, this nomination of Harris gives us a glimpse of what we hope American politics and the White House might look like in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The response to Harris’ nomination has been incredibly positive; for example, Jameela Jamil, a feminist, actor and activist for inclusivity responded to the announcement on her Instagram where she has a following of 3.3million with “a strong, smart, South Asian and Black woman in the Oval Office? Yes please. Also&#8230; so much Maya Rudolph coming to our screens. Win win win.” For those of you who don’t know, Maya Rudolph, best known for her role in Bridesmaids as Lillian, plays Kamala Harris on Saturday Night Live (an American late-night live television sketch and comedy show) and found out about the VP announcement whilst on air: she responded to the news in the witty way you would expect – “that’s spicy”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The timing and the choice of Kamala Harris for VP to many seems perfect, with the growth and power of the Black Lives Matter Movement, America needs a government that represents its beliefs; and who better than a woman of Jamaican and Indian heritage who participated in civil rights marches as a child and as a young woman. However, not everyone is on the same page. Harris was previously San Francisco’s district attorney and California’s attorney general, and was shown in her original Democratic Nominee Campaign that this was so that she could reform the criminal-justice system from the inside. However, the way she aggressively pursued cases without the commitment to reduce mass incarceration, something that is a key part of the antiracist movement, undermined this original ideology. Some people still aren’t convinced of this new relationship, as in the first Democratic debate she <a href=\"http://•%09https:/www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/biden-harris-busing-integration-became-flashpoint-debate-stage-n1024216\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">‘forcefully slammed Biden’s</a> history of working with segregationists and opposing school busing<a href=\"•%09https:/www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/biden-harris-busing-integration-became-flashpoint-debate-stage-n1024216\">’</a>. She said, “It was hurtful,” to hear Biden speak of his relationships with those senators as she told the story of a little girl who was in an early wave of children to integrate schools in California, ending it with the words: “That little girl was me.” Her popularity increased after this debate, but eventually had to drop out of the race due to the lack of financial funds. On announcing this she stated “… I want to be clear with you… I am still very much in this fight”: she was not wrong there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This turbulent year has shown that a huge part of activism is about having the capacity to change and adapt to the times. And although there is some doubt amongst Americans that because of her past Harris is the right choice, many have huge faith that she does in fact have this capacity to change and adapt to what the people need in her new role. A supporter of the nomination, Shaun King, an American writer, civil rights activist and co-founder of Real Justice PAC tweeted that “Kamala Harris is the most progressive VP nominee in American History”. This is probably why Donald Trump is already trying to question Harris’ eligibility to run for VP because of her parents’ immigration status at the time of her birth: a tactic he played with Obama for years saying that he was born in Kenya rather than Hawaii and therefore ineligible to serve as president. For some unknown reason he changed his opinions and stated in his 2016 campaign that Obama is actually an American, perfect timing Donald, perfect timing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How will this new duo succeed in ending this unthinkable era of Trumpism? Well, with women generally having higher rates of voter turnout than men, the significance of the gender gap in American politics is even more poignant at this time as women are more likely to support the Democratic policies, even regardless of the candidate! For example, more women than men favour policies such as access to health and child care, which are linked to Democratic party policies. Jotaka Eaddy, a former advisor to the N.A.A.C.P. and political strategist said that “Black women represent sixteen million voters in this election…We are the highest and most loyal voting block in the Democratic Party”. Eighty-two percent of Black women voters think gun laws should be stricter, and their leadership in the BLM movement shows how important the issue of police violence is for them in upcoming policies. With the race for the Democratic Candidate eventually decided by Black voters (61% of the voters for Biden in South Carolina were African-American), a Biden-Harris campaign that shows a real commitment to issues that Black women care about could truly be the end of Trump’s overstayed (un)welcome in the White House.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/gracebrowne/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">By Grace Browne</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/gracebrowne/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/622838b9b746d1af45a38bffc7494910?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Grace Browne\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/gracebrowne/\">Grace Browne</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

They looked at one another and asked me to elaborate. &#8220;A man and a woman go under the covers and kiss&#8221;. Age 9 my naivety was shattered as two classmates read the encyclopedia aloud to me &#8220;insertion of the penis&#8230;&#8221;. I was shook and went home and told my Mum the big, terrifying news. Age 11, we had our first official sex education talk &#8211; part one of two spread over two years. Many questions were met with, &#8220;that will be answered next year&#8221;. So much mystery and secrecy. Age 15 was a slideshow of STIs, a demonstration of condom application and an open Q&amp;A &#8211; &#8220;Why can&#8217;t men wear two condoms?&#8221;. Afterwards we told our teacher we should have received the lesson sooner. She was shocked and somewhat horrified.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What effect does this disjointed and limited teaching of sex education have on our perceptions of sex? Sex is only to be spoken of on occasion and in certain contexts? Sex is procreation and STIs? Does this breed taboo and shame? Must young people find out for themselves? If so, how? Literature? Film? Porn? Peers? Experience? If sex is procreation and STIs, then what is intimacy, have you heard of pleasure, who is there to talk to if you find yourself faced with dysfunction and when will education span beyond heterosexual sex?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does early education equal sex mania and teenage pregnancies? People recall their first crush as young as 3 years of age. Puberty begins as early as 9 years old. Teenagers discover masturbation before the legal age of sexual activity. If attraction, puberty and pleasure all happen before the age of 18 then why aren&#8217;t we providing adequate relationship and sex education?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A government review carried out in Ireland between 2018 to 2019 found relationship and sexuality education (RSE) to be “poor” and “inadequate”, with a focus on abstinence and risks such as STIs and teenage pregnancy. Student respondents highlighted a desire to learn about feelings, relationships, diverse family structures, sexual orientation, gender identities, consent, managing teenage pregnancy, and the impact of porn and the digital age on relationships and sex. Student respondents also highlighted the need to normalise talking about sex by having regular RSE classes and a shift away from risk orientated teachings towards honest discussions on the pressure associated with sexual activity and where to go when they need advice. In response to this review the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (<a href=\"https://ncca.ie/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NCCA</a>) has produced a timeline of key actions to improve RSE in Ireland, from the beginning of 2020 to the end of 2022. When speaking to a representative of the NCCA regarding an update on the success of this proposed timeline, I was informed the groups established to oversee the production of initial interim guidance have yet to meet secondary to Covid-19 but was assured that drafts are being compiled for presentation once public health advice allows. The NCCA hopes to publish some guidance materials to support the teaching of RSE before the end of 2020. Although this pace is not as pro-active as the situation requires it is statutory acknowledgment of the need for change. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>England, where I live now, is not far ahead as it has taken 20 years for the English Department of Education to review relationships and sex education. Relationship education will now address the cultivation of positive, safe relationships as well as recognising unhealthy relationships at primary school level. The curriculum at secondary school level will build on this incorporating relationship and sex education, addressing the development of intimate relationships, respect, commitment, boundaries, consent, safety online, contraception, sexual health, sexuality and gender identity, with the aim to inspire maturity, confidence, self-esteem and understanding. This updated curriculum is set to be rolled out in September 2020, but what about those of us that have long surpassed such formal education?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A history of restricted relationships and sex education has cultivated taboo culture around sex and relationships for the modern-day adult. How do we shake the shame? If your friends and loved ones are not ready to speak then find platforms that do. Read a book &#8211; #Love by Trish Murphy, listen to a podcast &#8211; How Cum with Remy Kassimir, watch a documentary &#8211; Sex Explained or a series &#8211; Sex Education. Acknowledge any reservation, question its origin and embrace the possibility of change. “The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking”, &#8211; Albert Einstein.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Withholding education doesn&#8217;t eliminate curiosity. Children and teenagers will open books (encyclopaedias in my case), watch films and porn, ask older siblings and peers and experience sex for themselves. The adults of today need to set an example. Not talking about it won&#8217;t silence it. Not addressing it won&#8217;t make it disappear. It will breed shame, uncertainty, discomfort and insecurity. Education by nature is enlightening, empowering and liberating. Whether you are a teacher, colleague, parent, grandparent, partner or friend &#8211; Let’s talk about sex. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/orlafriel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Orla Friel</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/orlafriel/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1db4841359148e7d67b14cb28bdf9c98?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Orla Friel\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/orlafriel/\">Orla Friel</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

A <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20181102-what-can-i-do-about-climate-change\">BBC article</a>, for example, noted multiple ways in which people can bring down their carbon footprint such as: flying less, walking more, shopping differently and eating less meat- the article also suggested that having less children might be an option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, in America, a <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/08/world/ipcc-climate-change-consumer-actions-intl/index.html\">CNN article</a> advised people to car share, use central heating less, and generally reiterated the impact of human behaviour on mitigating climate change. Other news items have called for a reduction in<a href=\"https://www.wwf.org.uk/updates/ten-tips-reduce-your-plastic-footprint\"> single-use plastics</a>, particularly <a href=\"https://eu.floridatoday.com/story/news/2019/09/26/plastic-straw-alternatives-reusable-straws-metal-straws-paper-straws/3776800002/)\">plastic straws</a> as well as taking <a href=\"http://www.bu.edu/sustainability/what-you-can-do/ten-sustainable-actions/take-shorter-showers/)\">shorter showers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/19/we-can-all-do-our-bit-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis\">turning lights off</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now for a disclaimer:<strong> There is nothing wrong with doing any of these things, and they are all probably beneficial for reducing your negative impact on the health of the planet. </strong>However, these articles and the overall trends pressuring individuals to make more carbon-friendly choices completely miss the point: that the responsibility for solving the existential climate crisis lies mainly with those with the most power to affect behaviour: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/10/individuals-climate-crisis-government-planet-priority\">governments</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In comparison to the impact of ordinary people, the damage being done to our climate by corporations is simply monstrous. <a href=\"https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/002/327/original/Carbon-Majors-Report-2017.pdf?1499691240\">Recent studies</a> have found that just 25 corporations (and state enterprises) are responsible for the majority of global emissions since 1988 (with 100 companies making up 71% of CO2 production). These numbers are mind-blowing and underlie how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2017/jul/17/neoliberalism-has-conned-us-into-fighting-climate-change-as-individuals\">meaningless</a> our individual actions are to the overall problem at hand. However, the prevailing discourse is still that we need to change our behaviour, this has become a mantra within mainstream media as well as for <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/09/04/kamala_harris_ban_plastic_straws.html\">politicians</a> all <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Environment/Plastic-straws-headed-for-reduction-in-Japan\">around</a> the <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/environment/environmental-protection/news/104056/michael-gove-announces-ban-plastic-straws\">world</a>. This, in itself, can lead to the justifiably angry reactions from right-wing political commentators: denouncing leftists for trying to take away their <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/gorka-democrats-want-to-take-away-your-hamburgers/2019/03/01/61ca0dab-e509-491f-b009-4e8e4348f18f_video.html\">hamburgers</a> and stop them from <a href=\"https://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/09/27/cancel-all-your-european-travel-and-vacation-plans-carbon-trading-extortion-is-here/\">going on holidays</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How has this happened? How have giant multi-national corporations been able to deflect the blame onto citizens? The short answer: neoliberalism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The policies of Thatcher and Reagan within the 1980’s and continued by Blair, Clinton, Cameron, Obama and now Trump have not only allowed companies to further get away with polluting through <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MOJAMbzKs\">large-scale deregulation</a>, but have also weakened the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2017/jul/17/neoliberalism-has-conned-us-into-fighting-climate-change-as-individuals\">levels of collectivism</a> within the public psyche. Thatcher famously stated that: “there is no such thing as society”, and this individualist rhetoric has been a mainstay of political discourse in the decades that followed. Now, millions of people in western capitalist democracies feel as if they are on their own in solving their problems- in getting a job and feeding their family, and now &#8211; on reducing their contribution to the death of the planet. Rightfully, many feel as if this is not their responsibility, that they don’t deserve to have to change their behaviours &#8211; especially when they are facing economic challenges in the wake of financial crises and austerity regimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what can be done? We saw what happened in France when Macron tried to implement a Carbon Tax that would disproportionately affect those who have contributed the least to the overall problem, ordinary working people. Macron’s proposition would have meant that lower and middle-class citizens, who spend a far greater percentage of their incomes on fuel and transportation than the wealthy, would be taking a far greater hit to their salaries than those at the top. The ‘<em>gilets jaunes’ </em>protests that followed, and eventually forced the President to cancel his policy, are indicative of the attitude of much of the public across the western world: <em>it’s not our fault, why should we have to pay?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We certainly cannot continue to live exactly as we are.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>At some point in the very near future however, people across the world will have to have rules enforced on them in order to prevent the most damaging effects of climate change. We certainly cannot continue to live exactly as we are. But alterations to our lives need not be accompanied by a loss of financial security, or by completely cutting out some of the aspects of our lives people most enjoy. This though, can only occur if those at the top are made to pay their fair share, and corporations who produce fossil fuels and excessively use unsustainable materials are effectively regulated by governments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take eating meat, as an example. This is one of the major issues we are constantly told is essential to reducing our carbon footprint as the agriculture industry makes up 25% of the world’s <a href=\"https://newfoodeconomy.org/climate-change-eat-less-meat-plant-based-impossible-burger-regenerative-ranching/\">greenhouse gas emissions</a>. The public are regularly bombarded with <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-09-20/letters-to-the-editor-if-you-eat-meat-youre-not-serious-about-fighting-climate-change\">articles</a> chastising them for eating meat and therefore contributing to this disastrous process of climate destruction. A recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/10/huge-reduction-in-meat-eating-essential-to-avoid-climate-breakdown\">UN report</a> even stated that a reduction in meat consumption was ‘essential’ for the fight against this. This line of thinking implies that the meat industry has to continue to work in the way it has been doing since the last half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. This does not have to be the case. Already, on an individual level, cattle farmers concerned about the impact their livelihood is having on the degradation of the planet have begun to implement <a href=\"https://newfoodeconomy.org/climate-change-eat-less-meat-plant-based-impossible-burger-regenerative-ranching/\">Carbon sharing</a> agriculture techniques based around <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/04/09/597617822/a-grass-roots-movement-for-healthy-soil-spreads-among-farmers?t=1570204991941\">‘greener’ soil</a>, whilst others have developed new methods of <a href=\"https://www.stonebarnscenter.org/blog/new-grazing-land-conservation-project/\">interrelated grazing systems</a> which reduce Carbon emissions. This is, of course, all happening on an individual basis without any government funding or outside help and as such, its scope is limited. However, the <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/CA1201EN/ca1201en.pdf\">UN’s </a>Sustainable Development Goals <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/CA1201EN/ca1201en.pdf\">report</a> also showed support for a declaration that: “Regenerative organic agriculture can sequester carbon and reverse climate change.”. Therefore, although these processes cannot be viewed as a fix-all for the agriculture industry, with serious top-down planning, financial and legislative backing from governments already spending vast amounts of taxpayer money on farming subsidies, there is hope. This method of solving emissions problems also restricts the damage to the working of farmers all across the world, many of whom whose families rely on meat production- as well as for indigenous groups internationally, for whom meat is an essential aspect of <a href=\"https://www.terraincognitamedia.com/features/vegan-activism-and-anti-indigenity-violating-indigenous-food-sovereignty2019\">their culture</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, many people may still have to slightly reduce their overall consumption, but this does not have to be strictly enforced on the public who made such little contribution to the crisis in the first place. Instead, national governments could and should restrict, by law, large-scale manufacturers and multi-national agricultural corporations from continuing their dangerous practices of meat production and must accompany this by providing subsidies for alternative, renewable methods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other areas of society, such as transportation and energy use, the public will eventually have to make changes. But again, this should not be at an individual level, and should be supported by financial assistance from corporations and governments. Whilst our current forms of car will have to be phased out and replaced by electric versions, governments need to find ways of making this as comfortable for consumers as possible, providing financial incentives to automotive companies and citizens themselves in order to counteract the justifiable negative reactions such policies will have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, it may seem like all these proposals being advocated will cost a lot of money.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>As major corporations are constantly replacing humans with robots, many are left without work.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Too right. But the saving of the planet was never going to be able to be done on the cheap. A policy of a worldwide Green New Deal to save the environment and create millions of new jobs in renewable industry however, comes with a wondrous solution to this: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/17/green-new-deal-climate-disaster\">it actually pays for itself</a>. Not only would this policy give us a realistic chance of solving the climate crisis, but would also tackle another existential threat facing human civilisation, <a href=\"https://www.commonspace.scot/articles/14349/summer-cs-forums-social-security-and-automation-richard-murphy-green-new-deal\">automation</a>. As major corporations are constantly replacing humans with robots, many are left without work. What the Green New Deal would do therefore is <a href=\"https://www.climaterealityproject.org/blog/green-new-deal-could-create-lots-great-jobs-so-why-all-hate\">create employment</a> through the transfer to renewable energy, as well as through training and maintenance of new systems of technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s left to us therefore, in terms of <em>individual responsibility</em>, is simply for citizens across the world to elect politicians and political parties who have this as part of the political platforms, and if no such parties have this in their manifesto: make them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This again though cannot be done on a personal basis, people need to work together collectively, organize and pressurize political leaders into bending to our will. This is what we saw in France, where public pressure led to most powerful man in the country changing his plans. The work of climate activists around the world is incredibly encouraging and climate strikes are undoubtedly beginning to have an affect. But progress will only continue if we make the right choices at the ballot box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing people must consider is providing external pressure to companies blatantly acting in ways which are unsustainable for the planet. This is not a new idea, as petitions to, for example, prevent supermarkets from using excessive amounts of plastic have already begun to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/22/tesco-promises-to-ban-brands-that-use-excessive-packaging\">have an effect</a>. But this is another aspect where the idea of individual responsibility should be side-lined in favour of a group-wide mentality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a clear difference between individuals making personal decisions on what items they buy and what companies they choose to buy from and sustained organised for more campaigns to change the behaviour of corporate institutions. If individuals choose to form groups which collectively act and pressurise such corporations this will have far greater effect than if people are doing small-scale actions on an individual basis. Corporations only claim to care about climate change because they know the public do, and cannot risk consumers turning away from them and <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikescott/2019/04/19/pressure-from-above-pressure-from-below-compels-companies-and-investors-to-tackle-climate-change/\">losing business</a>. Therefore, to make a serious impact, such action must be widespread and continuous until companies have no choice but to change their behaviour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not to say that people cannot freely choose to change their own behaviour in order to counteract the effects of climate change and bring down their own carbon footprint. However, such actions are unlikely to have a meaningful effect on the overall efforts to combat environmental decay and by focusing on such minute problems we are missing the wider point and distracting ourselves from the more serious and more damaging instances of anthropogenic effects on the planet. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To conclude, sorry Maggie but: <strong>there is such a thing as society</strong><em>, </em>and we must work together in order to give ourselves a shot at saving the world. Chastising individuals for their personal choices to eat a burger, take a flight or heat their homes will not make a dent in this, and may do more harm than good.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/glynsheldon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Glyn Sheldon</a></em></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/glynsheldon/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b6f4eedcc4559f94dd10458b659bb94a?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Glyn Sheldon\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/glynsheldon/\">Glyn Sheldon</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Ahhh, cancel culture. Where do we begin?&nbsp; Actually, where do we get off? For some people it’s literally at the drop of a hat, and for others, it takes a lot longer. I often wonder how much time people have on their hands to sit online with their anonymous chums, plotting how to end someone’s career. Now, I’m not talking about rightfully outing someone or bringing facts to people’s attention that create positive movements for change. No, my issue is with those who use social media and toxic hashtags to spread misinformation like wildfire.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, I want to say that I understand cancel culture has had its fair share of controversy, and although I’m not an avid hashtagger or sharer on socials, I too have got on board from the side lines when cancelling has been rightfully due. However, more than often a new cancel trend sweeps across our screens, generating momentum at remarkable speeds even if they aren’t as positive as they seem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may be thinking, where’s all of this coming from, James? Well, I have only just watched Killing Eve for the first time. I actually wasn’t that familiar with Jodie Comer before this, but after watching 24 episodes in record time, and making a few Google searches, I’m glad I am now. Funnily enough, it was during the attempted cancellation of the actress that I first watched her as Villanelle. Luckily, I’m not impressionable enough to read into click baiting headlines and I certainly don’t allow them to warp my opinion of something before I’ve formatted my own. Therefore, I watched the show and did some research with an open mind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing I want to say about Jodie Comer is that her performance is phenomenal; her voice acting, delivery and style creates a sympathetic outlook for a character who’s truly sociopathic, and who should have no emotional outlook at all. Secondly, I think that rumour mills shouldn’t give people the right to decide who a woman can date, even if he’s a Republican and a Trump supporter. It’s like going to university and isolating yourself from anyone who voted differently to you, I just don’t get it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I’m not American or a part of the LGBTQ+ Community, and although I detest anyone who is against equality for all, maybe I’m not in a position to feel as outraged by who she is dating (like a lot of Twitter seemed to be). However, after seeing comments criticising Comer for playing an LGBT character, speaking out on LGBT issues, and even posting a BLM hashtag, when she may or may not be dating a Republican, I can’t help but think &#8211; have people got nothing better to do than think &nbsp;about the worst in people?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe I’m just naive to the trend, but I think that rallying behind a hashtag like #JodieComerisoverparty and accusing her of fake white allyship is possibly damaging for any positive movement for change.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I understand that things might come to light which may make me eat my words, but let’s get a few things clear. Couples agree and disagree on many things, one of which will always be politics. The difficulty with this comes when you’re in the public eye and under constant scrutiny. Now, this may come as a surprise to those of you who have posted stuff to your stories like “if you’re a Tory, delete me now,” but people can disagree and still get along &#8211; still love, even.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could understand it a bit more if Jodie Cromer were American, but she’s not? She has no say in American politics. She can’t vote, she can’t run for office and she certainly shouldn’t be held accountable for her rumour mill “boyfriend&#8217;s” political outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Comers attempted cancellation, everyone’s favourite bigot JK Rowling has been trending again for her transphobic comments. I understand the need for Rowling to be “cancelled” to a degree because her views are just outrageous. However, how does that compare to Comer’s cancellation? The answer is: it doesn’t. The issue is jumping the gun, cancelling someone before they have even done anything – regardless of fact – and motivated by personal outrage instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What cancel culture like this suggests is that you should only align with people who share your views of life and that mixing, befriending (or even loving) someone else who differs from your political outlook is wrong. It is a toxic trend when unwarranted, and it can be counterproductive for so many reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let’s be real, I have no actual say when it comes to what people can post online, I just think that some of these trends need to be taken with a pinch of salt, instead of jumping on the bandwagon, trying to ruin someone’s career over rumours.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By James Merrington</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Please give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/jamesmerrington/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/03327dbffc8918dbdd4260cf05f0ba40?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"James Merrington\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/jamesmerrington/\">James Merrington</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Although it is rarely a major focus of the teaching that we receive, its ubiquity amongst elderly patients gives it a certain ever-present aura. Furthermore, its mysterious aetiology and the painstaking search for curative treatments makes it a difficult subject to fully understand. Some of us may have had the misfortune of watching loved ones suffer from dementia. Witnessing the progressive decline of the powerful figureheads that featured so heavily in our childhood can be exceptionally difficult to stomach. Many of us, however, will have had little experience of dealing with dementia aside from vicariously reading a memory walk fundraiser post on our Instagram page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I recently started my first job as a junior doctor. Emerging from the comfortable cocoon of wearing a bright red lanyard, equipped with the all-purpose ‘<em>I’m just a medical student</em>’ card, brings with it a number of mixed feelings of excitement and apprehension. My first job was on a geriatrics ward. These wards typically care for patients with an average age well over 80 years with never-ending drug charts and multiple co-morbidities. The complexity of their medical circumstances is compounded, dramatically, by cognitive issues such as dementia. Six years of medical education have developed our skills in clinical reasoning, communication and empathy. Each of these skills are tested to the limit when dealing with dementia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Managing dementia, hands on, for the first time as a brand new junior doctor triggers a number of emotions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/2667/1*PxOPl8B17GcqpHqKFcaVhg.jpeg?w=640&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Image for post\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sadness</strong>&nbsp;is a fairly predictable and natural emotion that the mere concept of dementia would evoke in anyone. Patients who struggle to care for themselves and maintain the most basic of human dignities were once budding professionals with razor sharp intellect. They were top class sports people, adoring parents and mischievous children. The intensity of the sadness resulting from dementia is, perhaps, most prominent in those who are still at the early stages of the disease. The awareness of your mind gradually slipping out of your control bears an enormous psychological burden. Observing the startling contrast between what a patient once was and what they are now instills a macabre appreciation of the fragility of life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Frustration</strong>&nbsp;creeps in as you begin to understand the challenges of working with patients with dementia. This frustration stems from the gnawing feeling that there is little that you can do to help in some cases. As cliché as it may be, many doctors are driven through a medical degree by the idyllic vision of using their knowledge and skills to see sick people get better. Working with patients with dementia, for whom modern medicine has nothing more to offer, can feel somewhat stifling to a young doctor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FEAR</strong>…is without a doubt, the most prominent of emotions. Learning medicine is sort of like a prolonged out of body experience. We learn about cirrhosis in long-term alcoholics and forget we have a liver, we learn about infective endocarditis and forget we have a heart, we learn about interstitial lung disease and forget we have lungs. For most medical students (especially those of us who, through good fortune, are yet to require any prominent medical interventions), there is a strange disconnect between the diseases we study and the possibility that they could affect us or our loved ones. The arrogance and invincibility of youth is seriously tested when we encounter dementia. As I mentioned earlier, people with dementia were just like us for the majority of their lives. It may have happened to our grandparents. It could happen to our parents. It could happen to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we step out of medical school and scan our shiny new ID cards through the automatic doors of our new wards, we are filled with zest and a burning desire to employ our knowledge to make a positive difference to our patients. A lot of proud rhetoric amongst new junior doctors revolves around our technical abilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>‘I nailed a cannula!’.</em></p><p><em>‘I got to do a lumbar puncture yesterday!’.</em></p><p><em>‘I prescribed TB drugs for Pott’s disease!’.</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Dementia brings us back down to earth. By disarming us as clinical interventionists, it makes us appreciate the humanness of our patients and it prevents us from facelessly pairing them with a Passmedicine question that we got wrong whilst revising for finals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On my first day on the ward, I noticed that all patients with dementia had an ‘<em>important things about me (ITAM)</em>’ form. Filled in with the help of their loved ones, it is a one page summary of the patient’s interests used to comfort them with familiar conversation in an unsettling environment. In other words, it’s a bittersweet summary of the things that give them any quality of life. To all the able-bodied and able-minded readers out there, take a moment to think…</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dr. Lasith Ranasinghe from <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meetmindset/\">Meet Mindset</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Please give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/meetmindset/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5940b52b8eaebb4bc31f8369b777affd?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Meet Mindset\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/meetmindset/\">Meet Mindset</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

We believe that style-conscious customers shouldn’t have to compromise between what looks good and does good for our planet. Sustainable fashion is the future and the future is now! The fashion industry is the second-largest polluter in the world, generating millions of textile waste annually. The typical textile process consumes around 40 litres of water and 40 grams of chemicals to dye and finish t-shirts. Any excess materials not used for the garment are simply discarded. Teaming up with Usha Yarns and their groundbreaking sustainability methods, All Wound Up seeks to make a change to the waste practices of the fashion industry. Using recycled cotton from cutting waste and polyester blend from recycled plastic bottles, All Wound Up t-shirts are made entirely from recycled materials.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/fashion-3.jpg?resize=640%2C641&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1803\" width=\"640\" height=\"641\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/fashion-3.jpg?w=828&amp;ssl=1 828w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/fashion-3.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/fashion-3.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/fashion-3.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/fashion-3.jpg?resize=500%2C500&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><em>All t-shirts are 100% recycled.</em> </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our clothing brand was born out of a student bedroom in Hyde Park, Leeds. We know that sustainable fashion for students typically takes the shape of thrift shopping at £15 per kilo vintage sales or endlessly scrolling through Depop – believe us, we’ve been there. Whilst second-hand clothes shopping is a great way to reduce waste, it doesn’t deal with the root of the problem. This is what we think needs to change! Our t-shirts are not only 100% recycled but of such high quality (if we do say so ourselves) that once you’ve had your wear out of them we’d love to see them circling around on Depop – follow us @awuvintage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our first drop features 3 logo tees with three messages we believe to represent the brand’s style and ethos. “<a href=\"https://allwoundup.co.uk/shop/timeismoney\">Time Is Money</a>,” <a href=\"https://allwoundup.co.uk/shop/onerevatatime\">“One Revolution at a Time</a>,” and “<a href=\"https://allwoundup.co.uk/shop/theworldisyours\">The World is Yours</a>.” We’d love it if you could support a growing small business and grab yourself one (or maybe all three) of our logo tees!

If you are reading this, please keep Lebanon and the Lebanese people in your prayers.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong>Beirut, Lebanon — August 04, 2020, 6:00 p.m.</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I decided to pay my family a visit. They lived in Jdeideh, on the coast of Metn, about twenty minutes from the Port of Beirut by car.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I sat on the couch, my legs stretched forward. Facing me was my cousin Christelle and my brother’s girlfriend, Vanessa. My mother and aunt sat a little farther on a separate couch, sipping on their traditional Turkish coffee and talking about the ever-inflating prices. It seemed as though this was all the Lebanese people could talk about lately, as the country spiraled into <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/lebanon-a-country-on-its-knees/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">economic</a> oblivion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We browsed for some pairs of denim jeans online. Our jaws dropped, not at how nice these pairs of jeans looked, rather at how one single pair of jeans went from costing around 40 US Dollars to the equivalent of 150 US dollars at the current rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I want to leave the country,” I said in a quick text to my boyfriend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>— Me too, babe, but why are you saying this now?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Truth be told, I had no idea. I was always adamant about staying and not giving up on my country. But at that very moment, all I could think of was how badly I wanted out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don’t know. I feel like I am suffocating.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s when I felt the ground shake beneath my feet before hearing what sounded like a small explosion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Silence. Utter silence.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We held our breath and looked at each other, perplexed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“What was that?” asked Aunt Nicole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>— Turn on the t.v., It could be another clash between Israel and Hezbollah.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We stood up and walked towards the balcony as my cousin opened the glass door. “Did you hear anything?” I said in another quick text to Moe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ground started shaking again, only stronger this time. The seconds stretched before we were all hit with a blast so strong it knocked us all to the ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/639/1*hNieZC1I5vJ5B_CQzbhUmg.jpeg?resize=640%2C482&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Image for post\" width=\"640\" height=\"482\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Photo Credit: Unknown</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Ears ringing</em>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing I heard was wailing. My aunt screamed as she curled up into a ball and pulled on her own hair. My mom rushed to the stairs. Vanessa fumbled for her phone to call my brother, while Christelle called her father to make sure he was alive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I rushed to my aunt. “Don’t be scared. Relax. Breathe. These are just Israeli planes raiding Hezbollah strongholds.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After all, we were used to that, Us the Lebanese; It is our sad reality. Stuck in between, bearing the brunt of a conflict that does not, in any way, resemble us, a conflict that does, by no means whatsoever, reflect our love for life, our ambition, and our ability to thrive, no matter the circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This, however, was beyond any of the atrocious tragedies we became so familiar with in this country’s deplorable existence. This . . . well, this was our knockout.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1024/1*jzO3r_w_df2MVi2f5Yvo-g.jpeg?w=640&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Image for post\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption>Photo Credit: Ibrahim Amro / AFP</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong><em>The Aftermath</em></strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what hell must feel like . . .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our phones started ringing. Rumors spread like wildfire. Was it a bomb? If so, who was the target? Little did we know that we were all victims this time around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Videos of the blast made international headlines within minutes. Hospitals were either destroyed or at full capacity, also within minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emergency rooms in local hospitals, or what was left of them at least, witnessed something unprecedented. In a country that boasts one doctor for every ten patients, we needed more doctors!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Damaged hospitals around the city begged and pleaded with the authorities to have their patients evacuated. Doctors stitched people up in the parking lot, under the light of their phones, as operation rooms and hospital beds were reduced to rubble.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/4096/1*UYo10MhwKrDp5pxtPKbEKQ.jpeg?w=640&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Image for post\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption>Photo Credit: Unknown</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Needless to say, no Lebanese got a minute of sleep that night. Whether you were injured, lost a loved one, or are still searching for them; whether you were displaced or not harmed in any way, we all died last night, we all felt as though we had lost someone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally no longer have the breath nor the energy to speculate. Pre-meditated attack or not, the trauma is real. An explosion that was heard all the way in Cyprus just rocked our beloved capital, Beirut, and its suburbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*n0VOFM2-PIGXAttlY12TfA.jpeg?w=640&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Image for post\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption>Photo Credit: Anwar Amro / AFP</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>They say 2020 has been hell, but 2020 has been a whole other level of hell for Lebanon. But as we struggle to cope with a pandemic, survive an economic meltdown, and wrap our heads around what just happened, we will open our eyes tomorrow and drag ourselves with a heavy heart to Beirut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will bury our victims and rebuild our homes. We will clean up the streets and help the wounded. Christian, Muslim, Druze, or whathaveyou, we will rush to help, because that is just who we are, and this is simply what we do.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/4096/1*t0pufxYISS5s8rwyboiRYw.jpeg?w=640&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Image for post\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption>Photo Credit: Unknown</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout history, Beirut was destroyed and rebuilt seven times. The eighth one will not be any different. How do we manage to do this? I don’t know. Solidarity? Hope? I genuinely have no clue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All I know is that the sun will shine on us once again. I don’t know when or how. All I know is that the sun will shine, on that tiny Mediterranean country with 350 days of sunshine, on that bunch of cedar trees always taking the world by storm.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Jennyfer Jaber</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DONATE TO LEBANON RELIEF</strong> via the Lebanese Red Cross:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://supportlrc.app/donate/donate.html?msg=success&amp;uid=0&amp;service=national&amp;donationid=14&amp;type=onetime&amp;total=5&amp;oid=UApPF&amp;station=&amp;token=&amp;fbclid=IwAR0iwAOV98yUWGDRc2xaUH0fbNRv1IwmfL95KzSjcRzN7ObvFrZbUseH3ic\">https://supportlrc.app/donate/donate.html?msg=success&amp;uid=0&amp;service=national&amp;donationid=14&amp;type=onetime&amp;total=5&amp;oid=UApPF&amp;station=&amp;token=&amp;fbclid=IwAR0iwAOV98yUWGDRc2xaUH0fbNRv1IwmfL95KzSjcRzN7ObvFrZbUseH3ic</a> </p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/jennyfer-jaber/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ee3b8023cab64879ef9777b111e07641?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Jennyfer Jaber\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/jennyfer-jaber/\">Jennyfer Jaber</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

But here goes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lebanon’s capital city, Beirut, has gone up in smoke, and this is no metaphor. In fact it is the showstopper in a maelstrom of tragedy and injustice the Lebanese people have suffered at the hands of a rotten establishment. For years the system has allowed its leaders to take billions of dollars from the state whilst failing to provide even basic electricity and water to its people. Since October 2019, a widespread protest movement began with demands for change and the removal of a government that fails to offer any kind of governance. This waged alongside a free falling economy, wrecking havoc as individuals scrambled to withdraw their life savings, only to find the banks restricting access to their own funds. The Lebanese lira, pegged to the US dollar, has lost 80% of its value causing hyperinflation. On the global stage, the country is no better off; landlocked by war-torn Syria to the east and old-enemy Israel to the south, it struggles for international friends. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now one of its key entry and exit points, its port, has been decimated in a vast explosion. The major port handles 60% of the country’s imports in a country that imports 90% of its goods, so the effect is grave. Not forgetting the food and supplies already docked, now laid waste in the apocalyptic scene of ash and debris left behind. The videos that circulated on social media documented billows of smoke and a building on fire, and then seconds later, a huge blast catapulting into the sky, finishing off with a nuclear-like mushroom cloud. People filming have their phones knocked out of their hands and are flung back, throwing those even 2km away off their chairs, shattering their windows and caving in their ceilings. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CDeYQZgJ7V4/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

It is a substance more commonly used in fertiliser, and has been the cause of numerous industrial explosions over the decades. So why was such a highly explosive material stored in the city, so close to residential neighbourhoods you ponder? For six years someone knew it was stored there, so the people shout criminal negligence and once more raise their fists at the government. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They say that even throughout the 15-year civil war, basic necessities were not as critical as this. No bullet hole or shelling ever wounded a building as badly. The forever volatile electricity in Lebanon has now been reduced to a dribble. A photo on Twitter showed doctors treating a patient in a carpark in pitch black, with their phone lights for guidance. Like the rest of the world coronavirus came knocking, but the state shut down the country within eight days of the first case, cautious for the beleaguered health system. Little did they know that such precautions would be redundant. Right now, four hospitals are so damaged they cannot operate and have lost staff, according to the World Health Organisation. The latest virus statistics released since the explosion depict a huge spike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Latest figures read 300,000 people have been made homeless. Thousands with life-changing injuries.This is a country sinking in debt, with the third highest debt to GDP ratio in the world, beating Venezuela by a hair. It is no win to be proud of. The prime minister, Hassan Diab, elected post-uprising in January 2020 has predictably declared “those responsible” will “pay the price”. Yet he is failing to see the problem: himself and his buddies in power. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the Lebanese sweep up glass and set up soup kitchens, they feel cursed, and acrimony towards the system, knowing nothing happens in Lebanon without a reason. One friend wrote “F**k this shit, they destroyed our capital and its people”. Once the debris is cleared, anger will replace it. And it already has. Social media is trending with “Hang up the nooses”; people are chomping for revenge and accountability. No leader or government official is yet to resign. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is easy to dismiss this as yet another Middle Eastern nation with a complex sectarian society, suffering at the hands of a crooked governance. But this is a good country with good people who received 1.5 million refugees from Syria and Palestine (Lebanon’s population is 5 million &#8211; if we did the same in the UK we would be indebted with 15 million refugees &#8211; just imagine that for a second). The Lebanese are one of the most intellectual countries in the region, with the most generous and good-willed people, born into a trilingual society of Arabic, French and English. They boast the freshest and tastiest food, a colourful, ancient culture, that sits wonderfully alongside beaches and ski slopes. They crack jokes and throw house parties, make sure your glass is never empty and don’t stop dancing until the sun comes up. They welcome you into their homes filling you with baba ganoush, tabbouleh and infectious laughing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But just when they thought their world couldn’t become bleaker, a monumental disaster struck. So I write now to urge you please, if you can to donate using the link below. No amount is too small. You are buying essential medical equipment like generators for hospitals, food for families and beds for children. Half of the population live below the poverty line, with the extreme poor on the brink of starvation. So please do not forget those sleeping tonight in windowless houses, brushing the glass and bricks off their beds, hollow with pain at the never-ending tragedy of Lebanon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope two things, as in times of darkness we have to look up. Firstly, that now the world’s eye has finally turned on Lebanon and the cracks are there for all to see, it will put pressure on the leaders to stand down. And secondly, that I succeeded in finding the right words in the right order to convey the cataclysmic fall of a great people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/rosabelcrean/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Rosabel Crean</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>LINK TO DONATION PAGE</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/lebanon-relief?fbclid=IwAR1HWWN7sZn1u3uFjd0AViVCfuImBN1DHYeBXcsfhAef2-tj_jfosipyoLA\">https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/lebanon-relief?fbclid=IwAR1HWWN7sZn1u3uFjd0AViVCfuImBN1DHYeBXcsfhAef2-tj_jfosipyoLA</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Please give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/rosabelcrean/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c7dc7433eeaadc1d52a425f70460a50c?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Rosabel Crean\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/rosabelcrean/\">Rosabel Crean</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

The idea was to divide and break up large concentrations of power into smaller, more manageable threats. Once these divisions had been created, either ethnically, geographically or religiously, the colonisers were able to stoke internal conflicts that avoided a unified anti-colonialist rebellion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, I will focus on the British Empire as an example in India and Ireland. The idea of divide and rule is relevant now because it, although less explicitly, still plagues today’s society. Racial and religious divisions are focused on by politicians and the media in order to stoke conflict between the lower classes whilst maintaining power at the top.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In India, there was a large minority of Muslims (around a third of the population) who had, for hundreds of years, lived side by side with the majority Hindu population. After a cross-religious rebellion threatened British rule in 1857, divide and rule became a British priority in order to maintain power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When limited franchise was given to the Indian people, the British did so by providing separate electorates for Muslims and Hindus. Muslims could vote for Muslim politicians in Muslim seats sowing the seeds of a divided nation. The All Indian National Congress, a cross-religion, anti-imperialist party tried to maintain unity throughout the country, yet the British would label them a purely Hindu party. Thus, in opposition to a ‘Hindu Raj’ the Muslim League lead by Mohammad Ali Jinnah rose in opposition demanding a separate state for Muslims &#8211; Pakistan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During World War Two when Gandhi and the Congress led the anti-imperialist Quit India Movement in protest to their forced involvement in the War, the British supported the Muslim League because of their support for the war effort. Throughout the 1940s, Hindu-Muslim violence and rioting became so extreme and the divisiveness had become so entrenched that the creation of East and West Pakistan became an inevitability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although after the War the British could no longer rule India due to the financial decimation of war, the divisions that they had endeavoured to create throughout the previous decades remained. The Partition of India led to the deaths of 1-3 million and the displacement of 17 million as a result of border lines being hastily drawn on a map. The rule did not last but the legacies of the divisions did &#8211; there have been four wars between the two nuclear powers since both countries gained independence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Ireland, the British identified the northern counties as the most fiercely resistant to British rule. They created the Plantation of Ulster in 1609 and English colonists aggressively settled the region in order to restrict Irish rebellion and create a division within the country.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The entirety of Ireland was made a part of the United Kingdom and many exclusionary laws were placed on Catholics within the now Protestant ruled country. As well as other laws and restrictions, Catholics were not allowed to inherit Protestant land, be a member of the Parliament of Ireland, or to vote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the 1900s, there were calls for Irish independence from British rule. Although independence was gained for the majority of the country, Northern Ireland opted out of the new Irish Constitution as a result of the colonialist settlement of the North.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the 1960s to the 1990s ‘The Troubles,’ which were fought between the Catholic nationalist IRA and the British Army, saw the decimation of Belfast as a result of decades of ongoing war. Although the conflict was ‘settled’ with the Good Friday Agreement of 1999 in which the Republic of Ireland withdrew its territorial claims over the 6 counties of Ulster, conflicts and division continue to this day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Belfast is literally divided by so-called ‘peace walls’ that separate the Catholic and Protestant communities. Catholic, nationalists in Belfast remain an oppressed people in Protestant dominated Northern Ireland as a result of the policy of ‘divide and rule’ used to separate and subdue a rebellious population. Divisions within the country were created in order to make it an easier country to overthrow and colonise, yet the legacies of that are hugely damaging and long-lasting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These two examples of divide and rule are relevant in today’s society because, although we do not live in a time of explicit empires and colonialism, we remain in an unequal, unfair society where the majority of power and wealth is held by large, immoral corporations. They influence politics for their own gain and stoke divisions to their benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is most abundantly clear in the current United States climate where Trump’s administration thrives on the divisions that they create and fuel. Working class, white Trump supporters are drawn into the xenophobic and racist rhetoric of Trump and his Fox News support that blame their lack of prosperity on immigrants, Jews, African Americans and other minorities. In actual fact, it is people like Trump and his political and economic empire that hold the wealth, however the divisions that they fuel inhibit a united rebellion against the increasing wealth gap and maintain divisions between working class people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although less explicit, this problem is endemic in the UK as well. Politicians and the media, who are incredibly closely aligned, focus on and exacerbate racial and religious divisions that pit the population against one another instead of aligned in opposition against the top. Syrian families who are escaping a horrific war are made out to look like nothing more than terrorists by these tabloid rags proliferating anti-Muslim stereotypes. In one incident The Sun made the debunked claim that ‘one in five Brit Muslims sympathise with jihadis.’ Similarly, The Daily Mail used old photos of injured policemen that were incidentally taken from an EDL rally in 2014 and used them to make the peaceful Black Lives Matter protests seem violent and unruly. In 2016, the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) singled out the Sun and the Daily Mail for “offensive, discriminatory and provocative terminology” that was helping to “fuel” discrimination. Their ambition is clear – to maintain a divided society in order to maintain the power and wealth of these conservative, right-wing companies such as Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, the Leave Campaign during the Brexit vote relied heavily on anti-immigration rhetoric as well as the support of these media outlets in order to proliferate the standard trope that ‘immigrants are taking our jobs.’ Nigel Farage’s anti-immigration poster that showed lines of non-white refugees with the slogan ‘we must break free and take back control’ was a blatant attempt at scaremongering and inciting racial divisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through these strategies the right has not only successfully created more divisions within the country than have been seen in recent years but also a regression in British foreign and economic policy with Europe. The powerful and wealthy use their influence over the media and politicians to influence the working class that it is the fault of someone of a different, ethnicity, religion or nationality as to why they are poor, not because the capitalist structure of the economy works on under paying labour in order to secure vast profit margins and bonuses for the boards. Immigration has been beneficial to this country as was abundantly clear throughout the coronavirus pandemic, without which the NHS would have fallen apart. It is important to not let the government and right-wing media outlets influence prejudice. As was clear in colonial India and Ireland, a divided people are weak and easily subjugated, a strong united population is one that can influence change and create opportunity and diversity.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/maxcoleman/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">By Max Coleman</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/maxcoleman/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7023fde74da06f2898eaf3492eb2da99?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Max Coleman\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/maxcoleman/\">Max Coleman</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">From June 25th to July 1st, Russia underwent President Putin’s latest referendum, which called the population to vote for or against the approval of a series of constitutional amendments. With an overbearing majority of 77%, President Putin marked yet another questionable milestone in his political career: the ability to overrule Russia’s constitutional term limits established in 1993 and remain in power for another 16 years at least. However, many were astounded to see that President Putin even bothered to run a general vote, which only served to somehow publicly legitimise what the Russian Parliament had already ruled in his favour months before. This does nothing other than confirm that the referendum was a carefully staged play, where the government pulled all the strings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the result looks like a victory from afar, what the Kremlin has done to achieve this is another story. With a series of campaign advertisements on state-controlled television news channels and recognised figures like Alexey Navalny, a prominent Kremlin opponent, calling the vote a “huge lie”, the referendum has been nothing but tainted with fraud from the very beginning. But what exactly does the vote entail for the Russian people? And what does it tell us about Russia´s seemingly anti-democratic political systems?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the obvious goal of keeping President Putin in power indefinitely, the amendments come as an attempt from the government to return to old-fashioned family values and views of cultural identity, which also emphasize the right to defend Russian history. For instance, the recently approved amendments would allow the government to ban same-sex marriage, which the Russian parliament has already started setting in motion just two weeks ago. With the approval of the amendments, the Constitution would now describe marriage as “the union between a man and a woman.” The prohibition would also reportedly extend to other members of the LGBTQ+ community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why it comes as no shock that Putin’s campaign leading up to the voting days seemed to adopt a “divide and conquer” approach by appealing to more conservative voters. For example, in a now deleted video posted by the Federal News Agency, it’s clear how the campaign inspired homophobic views. The video featured a gay couple meeting their adoptive son for the first time. One of them introduces his partner to the child as his “new mother”<em>,</em> who at the same time presents the child with a dress, much to the shock of the orphanage staff. The video then poses the question: “Will you choose such a Russia?”andfinally urging voters to choose in favour of the amendments. The video is clearly one that appeals not only to the voters’ personal feelings on “traditional family values” but also to a sense of patriotism. Moreover, just a day before the election, Putin addressed the country in front of a monument that honors soviet soldiers lost in WWII, compelling voters to believe that voting <em>yes</em> is a matter of national pride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The referendum has also been widely criticized for its suspicious procedures and lack of non-controlled state agencies to monitor the election. To give an example, the results released by the Central Election Commission (CEC), believed to be controlled by the Kremlin, published the results hours before the polls closed in Moscow. This strategy even draws similarities to President Putin’s 2018 re-election, where he won with only three quarters of the votes counted. So, what does this tell us about the President’s intentions? Whether it is the amendments alone or the manipulative propaganda that has taken over broadcast stations, this fundamental change to the Russian constitution is sending a clear message to the world of Russia’s plans to distance itself even further from Western values and democratic practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pandemic has also posed unprecedented opportunities for undemocratic methods. With still more than 7,000 Covid-19 cases reported every day, the current health and economic crisis that affects the country has placed many voters in vulnerable positions, making it easy for the government to approach prominent figures in the media or enterprises who went on to extort employees to vote. A New York Times article describes how Golos, an independent election-monitoring organisation, obtained a recording of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/world/europe/putin-referendum-vote-russia.html\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span class=\"has-inline-color has-very-dark-gray-color\">Ludmyla Savinkina</span></span></em></a>, editor-in-chief of the Russian television station Yegoryevsk Today, in which she is not only heard ordering her staff to vote but emphasized that those who didn’t faced severe consequences: “I’m just warning you… Everyone can lose jobs, bonuses -and this amid a pandemic, when many people have already lost their jobs.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, with the pandemic setting challenges for both Russians and the international community, Putin has seen an opportunity to stretch his dominance without much resistance. An article published by UCL´s student newspaper, Pi Media, shows how the pandemic has seen a rise in world leaders trying to gain more power by passing <a href=\"https://uclpimedia.com/online/in-conversation-with-zanny-minton-beddoes\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span class=\"has-inline-color has-very-dark-gray-color\">emergency laws</span></span></em></a>. In the same article, the Economist’s editor-in-chief, Zanny Minton Beddoes, raises an important question: “What does this mean for proponents of limited government and individual liberty?”<em> </em>For the Russian people it could mean a severe loss in fundamental rights such as freedom of speech and opinion. It only takes a glimpse at Putin’s campaign to see that the government has grabbed hold of the media, businesses and public institutions by the horns. In such circumstances, to what extent can we still call this a legitimate vote?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Putin could perhaps denominate this a victory, the referendum has certainly not passed unnoticed. Many Russians took to social media to protest posting NYET (No), on their platforms. <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-referendum-putin-07-01-20-intl/h_2f0b8ddea40b9f4240ade80f9955de63\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span class=\"has-inline-color has-very-dark-gray-color\">Marina Litvinovich</span></span></em></a>, a supporter of the movement even told CNN that the polls in Moscow and St Petersburg showed that around half of the voters did not approve the reforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the referendum seems to have had all the elements of a Broadway play: the stage, the actors, well thought out monologues to convey messages to the audience, and finally a swarm of applause at the very end. However, it’s safe to conclude that while achieving his desired outcome, President Putin is probably facing a severe loss in legitimacy in the eyes of both the Russian people and the international community. Whether Russians will find the strength to demand a new vote after the crisis, only time will tell.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/ainamartinez/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">By Aina Martinez</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Write for us: <a href=\"mailto:stories@herdcommunity.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stories@herdcommunity.co.uk</a></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/ainamartinez/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/71c34ef84ddac013aea4b21b9c3410f0?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Aina Martinez\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/ainamartinez/\">Aina Martinez</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

It’s ever so easy to fall down the rabbit hole of celebrity beef, love or hate an outspoken ‘alpha’ (Kanye West springs to mind) or eagerly call for the cancellation of some up and coming social media star, who has misused their platform with some unforgivable blunder. In the rush to join the drama the lines are getting blurred. Latest point in case, Wiley’s highly offensive antisemtic rant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Antisemitism is racism. Racism is not merely a blunder, nor should it be up for debate. However in this social media age of keyboard warriors, it seems racism can only fall into a firmly grey area. Instead of being purely examined for what it is, it has to ignite some kind of online culture war- frighteningly highlighting how toxic tribalism is destroying society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I heard about Wiley&#8217;s rant after getting news notifications which revealed that the police were investigating a series of antisemitic comments posted on his Instagram and <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/why-im-not-celebrating-katie-hopkins-being-banned-from-twitter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Twitter</a> accounts. The rappers hateful tirade asserted antisemitic tropes, including Jewish people controlling the money of countries and making venomous remarks that Jewish people should be shot. Naturally,  I went to Twitter to find out more, (Half of adults in the UK now use social media to keep up with the latest news, according to <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/latest/features-and-news/half-of-people-get-news-from-social-media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ofcom’s</span></a> annual news consumption report) The first opinion I came across was from British actor, writer, producer, director, ally of the Jewish community and Black Lives Matter movement Jolyon Rubinstein. The tweet, which has since been deleted, read this:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine if a Jewish person with a platform of half a million followers was tweeting for 24 hours straight the N-word, using dehumanising language &amp; nothing was being done by the platform. How is what Wiley is doing any different from that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>— Jolyon Rubinstein (@JolyonRubs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JolyonRubs/status/1286964694025220096?ref_src=twsrc%255Etfw\">July 25, 2020</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was quick to like this tweet, completely agreeing with the sentiment, as a black person who fully understands the painful (and this really does not cover it) experience of witnessing vile racism online, towards one&#8217;s community. Not soon after I received a message from a friend who spotted that I had liked the tweet and wanted to ask me my thoughts on whether it was pitting BLM against Antisemitism. I reread the tweet and my heart literally sank. Jolyon’s point still stands; Wiley’s rant was incredibly offensive and racist. Anti racist allies should be just as quick to call out antisemitism as anti-black racism. But why does this even need to be pointed out? If we are anti-racist we are anti all types of racism and the race of the perpetrator isn’t the issue- the issue is that they are racist. Although Jolyon did not specifically mention Wiley’s ethnicity, he has framed his passion against anti-Semitism by comparing it to the plight of another oppressed group, the black community. A group which Wiley belongs to, a group which the Godfather of Grime’s fans (if he still has any) may also largely align with.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. Wiley is no spokesperson for black people. And although Grime is firmly rooted in black British culture, this doesn&#8217;t mean that all black people are going to jump to Wiley’s defence. But why are we even speaking about this? Is what black people in particular feel about this issue the most important thing to analyse in response to Wiley&#8217;s outburst? It should be noted how quickly social media activists have jumped to put out content which expresses that black activists stand with their Jewish friends, and remind us that black Jews exist. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The echo chamber of Twitter is on fire. People want to discuss whether Jewish institutions have been disproportionately vocal about anti-Semitism from black celebrities, there are tweets asserting ‘Black Hebrew Israelites aren&#8217;t real Jews’ and #JewishPrivilege is trending. Some people feel the moderators of Twitter have been too harsh on Wiley because he is black and some people feel they have not been harsh enough-because he is black. Through this minefield of opinions I can only conclude one thing. This is all detracting from the issue at hand. Wiley is a racist, and as an avid music fan whose introduction to grime was largely through his 2012 album Evolve or Be Extinct, this greatly saddens me. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, we do need to speak up about the lack of criticism towards his comments from those usually vocal on other forms of racism. But do we need to clarify that antisemitism is racism by comparing one group&#8217;s experience of racism with another’s? The woke twitter community, who were quicker than me to realise how Joylon’s tweet undermined itself, alerted the activist of why his comparison didn&#8217;t sit right. Joylon gracefully accepted the criticism, remedying his tweet with this afterthought:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Well thank you for making me aware. Ultimately equating the two has been unhelpful &amp; taken away from the basic point that Wiley he is responsible for his own actions. <a href=\"https://t.co/OGJ0QfB1mC\">https://t.co/OGJ0QfB1mC</a></p>&mdash; Jolyon Rubinstein (@JolyonRubs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JolyonRubs/status/1287032114597240832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 25, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In this instance it&#8217;s encouraging to see that Twitter has been able to facilitate an open discussion, and an individual of a high profile has for once demonstrated self awareness, legitimising his views and not just being an outright bigot. But this is just a tiny victory in the midst of a much larger mess.&nbsp; To some extent it was Wiley that made this about the black and Jewish relationship, tweeting ‘I don’t care about Hitler, I care about black people’ and comparing followers of the Jewish faith to the Ku Klux Klan. But it was not Jolyon’s job to carry on the examination of the black- Jewish relationship, which he has rightfully acknowledged, by pointing out that Wiley is responsible for his own actions. But Jolyon is not the only one, who to some extent, almost subconsciously drew the parallels. As already mentioned, the parallels ring true, but what it adds to the ‘debate’ is dangerous. When I heard what Wiley had said I thought he was a clown. But the online debate I have stumbled upon has alerted me to the fact that some people will not simply be thinking he is a clown- they will be thinking that he is a black clown. So what do we do?&nbsp; Maybe, as this is an issue about racism, it is naive to think the race of both sides involved won&#8217;t be scrutinised. What is very wrong with this very sentence is the fact that we can even see ‘sides’ at all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an ideal world, whether Wiley should be condemned, to what extent he should be condemned (he’s been rightfully dropped by his management, Facebook has banned him, his tweets removed from Twitter) should not churn up any debate. There should be no tolerance for antisemitism and we need to show solidarity with the Jewish community. But with the suggestion that Wiley is representative of BLM, an online culture war has derailed the real event. The minorities of British society remain polarised, fearing their individual movements will be diminished by the recent events, and so the side taking goes on. The hot button topic becomes less about morality and more about a struggle for dominance of values and beliefs &#8211; one which only further facilitates division and hate. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Links to useful articles/resources around antisemitism:</span></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CCtUxL2lvDv/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

While the hashtag was quickly regained by the users who were Jewish sharing their own stories, we’ve created this for non-Jewish allies as a way of identifying antisemitism, so we can all speak out against it. . . . .

With the enforcement of lockdown in March this year, common place year-round events such as music concerts, theatre productions, festivals and sports matches became events of the past; falling under the category of ‘mass gatherings’. The thought of being in such a close proximity to a high number of other people became both unthinkable and undesirable. In lieu of these live events, reruns of popular theatre productions and music concerts were streamed to our homes, with a large proportion of people preferring this new way of living from the comfort of their own sofa. However, although it can be nice to reminisce, nothing could ever replace the feeling of adrenaline you get watching a live game alongside fellow fans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s clear that the loss of watching a certain sport live hit a lot harder across the nation than many other events. Yes, football left an empty void in every household in some way shape or form. Since 1992, on a weekly basis the Premier League has been a huge part of people’s social lives and calendars. The Football Association has even said that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/53441670\">&#8220;Supporters</a> are the lifeblood of our national game, and that has been underlined by how much their absence has been felt over the last month,&#8221;. So, with life slowly returning to normal and shops, restaurants, pubs, cafés and gyms all reopening, it was only a matter of time until we found a way for football to return as well. After three months of lockdown, it was announced that the Premier League would return with two matches per team each week behind closed doors in attempt to finish the 2019/20 season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the streamed matches brought the joy of football back in to our lives, it was tainted by the empty stadiums and reinforced the fact that the social aspects of football must adapt to continue within the midst of this pandemic. Above all, it showed us how the game as we know it had become so different. Before the pandemic, many people would never have thought twice about the proximity of fans in every aspect of a football game. From walking through the ticket turnstiles, queuing for a burger and a pint at half-time, moving through rows to get to your seat and sitting thigh to thigh with the person next to you. When you see the empty stands in the most recent games you truly realise just how many fans would be squashed into the stadium and the importance of a live crowd. Although these games have filled that void and finally given us something new to talk about with each other, the added crowd noise can only do so much when juxtaposed with the empty seats.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With rumours circulating that a second spike could be around the corner, along with the announcement that fans will be able to attend sporting matches in October, clear cut rules must be put in place for supporters to return to games without fear. To help with this, pilot projects will take place to help with the wider reopening of sporting stadia in the late autumn. Currently, the chosen pilot projects will be: two men&#8217;s&nbsp;county cricket&nbsp;friendly matches at The Oval on 26-27 July; the World Snooker Championship&nbsp;at Sheffield&#8217;s Crucible Theatre from 31 July; the Goodwood horse racing festival on 1 August. More pilot events are likely to be held in other sports, but these chosen ones (and more events to follow) will have to follow strict government guidelines which include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Fans must agree to a new code of behaviour that includes not attending if they potentially have symptoms of coronavirus or have been exposed to a person who has tested positive;</li><li>Social distancing must be observed in seating arrangements;</li><li>Crowd management plans should be in place, including the controlled entry and exit of fans and one-way systems;</li><li>Screening procedures should be considered at stadium entrances.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The only way people will feel safe enough to attend such events will be if there are strict rules in place to protect them. And people must adhere to them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A huge part of football and sporting culture is drinking; meeting friends for a pint before a game, one at half time, and often many after. This aspect of sport, which is so widely loved, could well turn out to be a negative. Some people may be put off attending a game as alcohol reduces your inhibitions and, much like with many cases of events in lockdown where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/15/summer-of-illegal-raves-expected-in-england-despite-coronavirus-crisis\">alcohol has been present</a>, social distancing often goes out the window. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a sport lover myself, I know that I would want to attend events if they start to return later this year, but only if the guidelines the government have stated are enforced. I think it is important that as fans we cannot expect the sporting culture to be like it was in the good ol’ days pre Covid-19. In turn, we must not hold the games and players to these expectations as well. Being able to share with complete strangers the common ground of supporting a team live at a stadium, and the adrenaline that comes with it, cannot be replicated. But fans will need to be open to relearning this new way of supporting sport. Yes, unfortunately that will mean controlling yourself when your team score or win and not hugging that random person next to you in euphoria (seriously, control yourself). Following your sport will be completely different to how it was before, but in the hope that in the future we can return to the scenes like the ones of the Cricket World Cup 2020, or the Champions League Final in May 2019, we’re just going to have to suck it up for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Grace Browne</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Rate and comment on this article below!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Write for us: <a href=\"mailto:stories@herdcommunity.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stories@herdcommunity.co.uk</a></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/gracebrowne/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/622838b9b746d1af45a38bffc7494910?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Grace Browne\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/gracebrowne/\">Grace Browne</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

No one in my vicinity was holding wool or knitting needles, alas we giggled at this sexist comment. It’s strange the memories that stick with you. I continued on to a single-sex secondary school, female dominated university course (approximate ratio 32:1) and in turn a female dominated career. It is only recently that I have realised the sheltered experience I have had in my adolescent to adult years. I had allowed this experience to feed my ignorance of the ever prevalent existence of sexism in today’s society and the importance of understanding and supporting feminism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a conversation at work, a female colleague exclaimed, “I bet you&#8217;re one of those men hating feminists”. Feminism is not a weapon with which to attack men or release suppressed anger or hate. It is a call for equality where there is stark inequality. Hate has no place in the fight for equality. “Manhood and masculinity” are plights embroiled in a fierce and unforgiving social construct that has bred hate and bullying. Meanwhile, “womanhood and femininity” have been branded with expectations that separate women from the social stature of men.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Women’s right to vote, women’s right to work after marriage, women’s right to serve on a jury, women’s right to equal pay and opportunity, women’s right to contraception and abortion have all been fought for within the last 100 years. The span of our grandmothers, mothers and our lifetime. Victories have come in stages. Rights have had to be&nbsp;<em>granted</em>&nbsp;as if they were privileges, rather than human rights.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such laws have had an impact on culture. Sexism was, and in some countries still is, validated by law and constitution. The Marriage Bar in Ireland banned married women from working in the public sector as it was deemed negligent towards duties in the home. My grandmothers were subjected to this law. It remained in place until 1973. How were women to be seen as equal to men when their constitution enforced inequality? When law supports inequality it breeds grounds for gender-specific roles, gender-specific jobs, discrimination, misogynistic attitudes and sexual harassment within society.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Orlalist.jpg?resize=404%2C575&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1729\" width=\"404\" height=\"575\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Orlalist.jpg?resize=210%2C300&amp;ssl=1 210w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Orlalist.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=404%2C575&amp;ssl=1 808w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>How is society today? In a 2019 study by Ipsos MORI, in collaboration with the Global Institute for Women’s Leadership and International Women’s Day (IWD), on global attitudes towards gender equality, sexual harassment, sexual violence, physical violence, equal pay, domestic abuse, workplace discrimination, balancing work and care responsibilities, sexualisation of women and girls in media, the amount of unpaid work that women do, gender stereotyping, lack of women in leadership roles, lack of financial/econonmic independence, access to employment, support for pregnant women and new mothers, abuse on social media, forced/child marriage, access to childcare, parental leave rights, access to healthcare, access to family planning services, access to education and access to sanitary products were listed as issues which women currently face on a global level. How can we fight this ever present tide of issues facing gender equality? Awareness is a start. We don&#8217;t need to be experts. We just need to be open to learning, and understanding will follow. I was recently gifted with a starter pack &#8211; see picture below. Instagram pages can be a source of inspiration. Let posts filter positive thoughts and evoke change. I personally enjoy <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/freeda_en/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@freeda_en</a> for their daily doses of support for equality, acceptance and encouragement for change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A recent accolade in female equality can be seen in the #MeToo movement in which women began to speak up about their experience of sexual harassment and assault. Sexual harassment and assault are a by product of extreme sexism. This movement gave many women the courage to speak for the first time. It aided the creation of a society in which women are listened to rather than interrogated and supported rather than judged. A unity of survivors and allies formed, trials commenced and justice was granted proving that raising awareness can impact change and there is still change to be had.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As women we have been influenced by society to be jealous and despising of other women. We target other women for being prettier, slimmer, more stylish and nothing is thought of men holding the equivalent aesthetics &#8211; because they are not our competition. Why are we more concerned with beating another woman rather than being enough for ourselves? Do not allow this aspect of anti-feminism to trick you into thinking you have to alter yourself to be enough. If we maintain this attitude we will continue to isolate not only ourselves but all women.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feminism is a stigmatised concept. Feminism has evolved through different movements and feminists have varying belief systems and differentiate between one another based on their core ideologies, but feminism is not an out of reach concept. You are not required to shout from a podium, burn your bra or bin your razors. Feminism at its core is a desire for equality. If you support equality you support feminism. Fight the stigma. Know your worth.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Orla Friel</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Rate and comment on this article below!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Write for us: <a href=\"mailto:stories@herdcommunity.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stories@herdcommunity.co.uk</a></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/orlafriel/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1db4841359148e7d67b14cb28bdf9c98?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Orla Friel\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/orlafriel/\">Orla Friel</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

The answer: they are all quintessentially British things, without which we would inevitably perish. As it happens, I have just finished half a can of Sour Cream and Onion Pringles while writing this because it’s never just the one, is it? Unless you are a psychopath, in which case, it is relatively safe to assume you are beyond help. Another item to be added to the above list, filed under <em>essential</em>, is the ability to laugh at ourselves. British people, irrespective of social standing, class or background, are absolutely united by self-deprecation, deadpan delivery and scathing sarcasm. Brits are known for laughing in the face of adversity and pushing the boundaries. Gallows humour, setting farts alight, passing out from alcohol, and making a tit of yourself are all rites of passage for the British. <em>Monty Python</em> <em>and</em> <em>The Holy Grail’s </em>popularity speaks for itself. Only in Britain, could you make entertainment out of clanging together coconut halves to substitute actual horses and refer to a severed limb as a “sharp scratch”. <em>Peep Show,</em> another cult classic, epitomises British satire. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, more than ever, we need a reason to laugh. We need comedy, we need live entertainment- just as much, if not more so, than a lukewarm beer served in a plastic pint glass, dependent on the thermometer reading of course. Humour is such a tonic, and without widespread financial support from the government, philanthropists and consumers alike, the live comedy scene is in grave danger &#8211; with a new study suggesting that over three-quarters of comedy venues are at risk of permanent closure, as reported in <em>The Guardian</em>. The most recent government update has now clarified that live comedy <em>will</em> be included within the £1.5 billion pledge for the <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/the-threat-of-theatre-closure-a-memoir-from-behind-the-bar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">arts</a>. However, the future of stand-up comedy remains uncertain, and even with the easing of social distancing measures. Inevitably, punters will be hesitant to flock once more to buzzing comedy clubs on a Tuesday night, beverage in hand, feeling self-congratulatory for choosing a seat at the back of the audience. While many comedians have utilised online resources, the communal indulgence of a shared joke is lost in translation. There seems to be something quite sad about giggling alone into your laptop, three glasses of Pinot down – or so I’ve heard, anyway&#8230; Stand-up comedy provides an invaluable form of escapism for the masses – without which the grim reality of job losses, illness and the confines of the living room becomes all too stark. During a global pandemic, we need all the comic relief we can get. We need the unity comedy brings. Humour is a practical, tried-and-tested coping mechanism for a plethora of everyday situations. These range from, for example, swigging a bottle of water in a hungover state, only to discover a few gulps later that you’re inadvertently drinking vodka at 9am. Perhaps you have eagerly risen at 4am and only once in the departure lounge do you realise that your flight is not for two weeks. We’ve all been there&#8230;We need to laugh; otherwise, we will cry – perhaps uncontrollably. Humour is versatile, robust and reliable – all elements, some sceptics may argue, the government authorities currently lack. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cancellation of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, for the first time in its 73 years of history, had a devastating impact upon the performers, organisers, punters and the economy alike, as the world’s biggest arts festival. The economy has been left reeling from the colossal financial blow, estimated to be a £1.5 million budget deficit as reported by&nbsp;<em>The Guardian</em>. In response to Covid-19’s curse on comedy, talented individuals and industry professionals have devised new campaigns, such as the <em>Live Comedy Association</em> – to act as an innovative network. Top of the agenda for the <em>Live Comedy Association</em> is presenting a united front and facilitating fundraising to generate desperately needed support for live comedy. The comedy industry is under a tremendous amount of pressure to not only survive, but to flourish, during Covid-19 and&nbsp;<em>thereafter</em>&nbsp;to ensure that live comedy has the last laugh in the face of austerity. Despite government pledges for emergency funding, this is no time for complacency as the industry is a long way off financial stability, and not every job or small business can be saved. The future of live comedy is no joke. Those hit the hardest will not be the household names we cherish, &#8211; instead, the force will be felt by the budding artists who worked tirelessly to break into this competitive industry. In the communal spirit that characterises live comedy, we need to rally together to save the industry in the hopes that the nightmarish implications of Covid-19 will merely serve as comedic fodder for future live sets &#8211; think of all the new material! We will look back and laugh. Oh, how we will laugh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To see how you can support the live industry, go to: <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://livecomedyassociation.co.uk/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://livecomedyassociation.co.uk/about</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Lucy Summerton</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Rate and comment on this article below!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Write for us: <a href=\"mailto:stories@herdcommunity.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stories@herdcommunity.co.uk</a></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/lucysummerton/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e211ae2b8a4f7756ff4971bc6bec5e81?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Lucy Summerton\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/lucysummerton/\">Lucy Summerton</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Since then, the UK has moved from a Covid-19 alert level of four to three. Pubs, restaurants and hotels re-opened on July 4<sup>th</sup>, while ‘air-bridges’ have begun to allow travel between the UK and specific European holiday destinations. Much as a thirsty man savours a long-awaited drink, this new-found liberty feels particularly good. And yet, our ‘new-normal’ is far from a return to how things were. A trip to the pub requires one to register their details on arrival. You are likely to have to book in advance, must order drinks digitally and, in some cases, must adhere to one-way systems while moving about. When travelling by bus, train or tram you have to wear a facemask and, on trips to the supermarket, it is likely you will spend as much time in the queue as actually shopping.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The country we emerge into is one of red tape and bureaucracy, terms and conditions. What freedom we have gained is dictated over by rules and guided by regulations. This is undoubtedly necessary to control the virus, and yet, this knowledge does little to alleviate the frustration…&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A different sort of lockdown calls for a different kind of escape. Rory Stewart’s walk across Afghanistan, recounted in <em>The Places In Between</em>, is an examination of the seemingly ungovernable and a celebration of personal agency over toeing the line. For me, it was a breath of fresh air from the government’s suffocating exit strategy…</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong>Rory Stewart, ‘The Places In Between’</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>In the winter of 2001-2, over 36 days, Rory Stewart walked east from Herat to Kabul in a straight line through the central mountains of Afghanistan. The country had only been liberated from Taliban control for 6 weeks and a new government in place for only the last two of those. Along this 800km+ trek there are only a scattering of administrative centres found at Obey, Chaghcharan, Yakawlang and Bamiyan. The villages in between these governmental oases are exceedingly remote and were without electricity or plumbing. In most houses, foreign technology was limited to a Kalashnikov and, ‘the only global brand was Islam.’&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1.jpg?resize=227%2C327&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1717\" width=\"227\" height=\"327\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=227%2C327&amp;ssl=1 454w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image1.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=227%2C327&amp;ssl=1 681w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><em>The front cover of ‘The Places In Between’. A photo taken by Stewart of the dome at Chist-e-Sharif, built by the ancient Ghorid people. </em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This ‘ungoverned space’ has been a great crossroads of cultures, religions and peoples. It is where Persian, Hindu and Hellenic culture come together. Where Muslims and Buddhists rub up against one another, Shias and Sunnis co-habit and mystical Islam meets its militant equivalent. It is where the first folds of the Himalayas rupture the Afghan desert and, as a result, has been a natural thoroughfare and obvious route for the Silk Road. It is a country that, in 2002, had been at war for the last twenty-five years. First with the Russians, then with the Taliban before the new government’s takeover under Ismail Khan. It is a patchwork nation &#8211; a great web of loyalties and feuds, cultural etiquettes and traditions. Along Stewart’s trek alone he crosses through the plains of the Tajik people; the hill province of Ghor, where the nomadic Aimaq tribes live; the high mountains of the Hazara and the deserts of the Pashtun tribe. The Afghanistan he discovers is exceedingly complicated and, at its very core, opposed to centralized government. Any decree on facemasks, advice on handwashing or edict on supermarket queuing is a world away. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also an incredibly hostile environment. Over the three months preceding Stewart’s walk sixteen foreign journalists were killed in Afghanistan. The country is filled with those who supported, or were actively part of, the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Landmines litter the way between Herat and Kabul and wolves have been known to kill and eat people in the middle of the day. His route sees him cross high mountain trails he’s repeatedly been told are impassable in winter. He walks them in January, without a map. Stewart often does not know where he will sleep for the night. He relies, instead, on the hospitality of strangers and their adherence to Islamic guest rights. Gestures of surprising warmth and companionship are afforded him by these hosts, with a sense of shared human comradery often shining through hardened Afghan exteriors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2.jpg?resize=616%2C463&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1718\" width=\"616\" height=\"463\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=616%2C463&amp;ssl=1 1232w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image2.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=616%2C463&amp;ssl=1 1848w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><em>Stewart’s route from Herat to Kabul, through the central mountains of Afghanistan</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Time and time again Stewart is told that the journey is not possible or will result in his death. The security service inform him before he sets out, ‘you will die, I can guarantee’. They make him walk the first leg with two guards. It is one of these guards who discovers that there are multiple groups on the road ahead with plans to murder them and begs him to take a car. Stewart tells him he is ‘leaving in an hour regardless’ and walks. When passing into Pashtun territory, a hotbed of Taliban support, his Hazara host insists he travel by car. Stewart walks. Before he traverses the great snow plateau between Bamiyan and Yakawlang a group of Spanish doctors, fresh from the operating theatre and a morning of amputating frost-bitten legs, implore him to drive. Again, he walks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stewart refuses to accept the parameters others try to place on him. His independence and strength of will drive him on through a journey most people would consider impossible. He does so with only a stick and a dog for safety. What he truly relies on for protection is his own quick-thinking and ability to bluff. He turns changing the subject into an art form and weaponizes his knowledge of Islam. In Dideros, he is accused of being a British spy by an Al Qaeda sympathising Mullah. He denies this, before responding, ‘I have been travelling in Iran and Pakistan, where I was treated very well because Muslims know how to treat guests.’ The accusatory tone of the room quickly turns to one of conciliation as his hosts mumble, ‘Of course we treat guests well…’ ‘Because we are Muslims…’ ‘We honour travellers.’ Toward the end of his walk a man tries to take four hundred dollars from him. Stewart inquires, ‘is this a request for <em>zakat</em>?’, referring to the obligatory Muslim donation to the poor. The would-be mugger recoils at this, having had his pride and piety subtly questioned, and decides he no longer needs the money. While being straddled by a particularly unsavoury group in Pashtun territory, the ex-Taliban leader of the area quizzes him on his faith, repeatedly asking, ‘Who do you think is better: Usama Bin Laden or George Bush?’ Stewart masterfully dances around these questions, frequently mentioning that ‘[he is] a guest in [their] country’ and playing on their requirements to honour Islamic guest rights.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <em>As I Walked Out One Midsummer’s Morning, </em>Laurie Lee revels in his freedom, wallowing in a youthful lack of responsibility. Stewart, on the other hand, seems eager to discover the boundaries of what others deem possible, only that he may exceed them. He is almost entirely self-sufficient, relying on his own two feet for transport, his wit for protection and a sense of self-belief to drive him forward. Much like Afghanistan itself, he refuses to be told what to do. In a world where even leaving the house has fallen under the jurisdiction of others, the sense of having control over one’s own existence that suffuses <em>The Places In Between </em>can serve to remind us of more liberated times. It certainly did for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>By Will Bruce</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Rate and comment on this article below!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Write for us: <a href=\"mailto:stories@herdcommunity.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stories@herdcommunity.co.uk</a></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/willbruce/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e614ed2c8783c4c620801627b415b481?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Will Bruce\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/willbruce/\">Will Bruce</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Whether that desire has lasted (I hope it has) comes down to the level of privilege you enjoy, but that’s a conversation for another day. For now, let’s agree that viewing explicit pain and violence has immense power. But here, I ask why.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is simply hearing about stories of injustices no longer enough for us? Was it ever enough for us? Why must we devour increasingly upsetting and violent videos and images to believe what we are being told is true? Why is there this requirement placed on the sufferer to be vocal <em>and</em> convincing for others to open their eyes and show compassion? We should not have to see explicit suffering or sadness in order to act. This obsession with proof and performance is excessive and damaging as this demand is too painful and difficult to fulfil for many. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, this year the <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/the-education-to-employment-transition-prioritising-your-mental-health/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mental Health</a> Awareness Week’s theme was kindness; a stark reminder that we’ve all become less kind. It’s absurd that a week had to be dedicated to something we should all be doing all the time anyway. It appears we need to re-learn how to be kind and to be reminded of its importance when kindness should be the default in human behaviour. Is it not kindness that is the absolute bare minimum that’s expected from us? Reminding people to be kind is as absurd as reminding people that racism is bad. Imagine having to still do that in 2020…&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why do we wait until people feel forced to explicitly tell us that they’re not okay before we acknowledge it or try and help? It appears we’re not great at noticing signs anymore (were we ever?) or simply turn a blind eye to them because we don’t want to have uncomfortable/sad conversations or, quite frankly, we feel we don’t have the time to deal with other peoples’ problems when we’ve got our own to worry about. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we grow older, somewhere along the way and without even realising we become more sceptical, impatient and judgemental, and ultimately less kind, understanding and compassionate. I bet you want proof for these statements. So let’s start with the recent unrest caused by minorities suggesting they were being treated unfairly. Why was the response from some to demand proof (even if the intention was to educate themselves) or divert attention to other matters? And next, why is wearing a mask during a pandemic a debate? Even if they turn out to be useless, is it not better to wear them just in case they help others? Some people don’t think so. This is the sad reality in a world where 25% of us will deal with some mental health illness. This statistic is surprising to me, not because it seems high but because out of all my close friends and family I can honestly count on 1 hand, the number of people who fall in the other 75%. So, I either have some secret power that attracts only a select few to me or that first statistic should be a lot higher to reflect the reality I see. There are a lot of people who are fighting their demons quietly and don’t yet feel comfortable speaking to a doctor or even their friends about any of it. And there are many who are either in denial or just haven’t yet recognised that they are actually suffering and that those panic attacks aren’t a ‘normal’ thing that happen to everyone. This is why kindness is important. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should say that I am not an expert on being nice or mental health or on how to help someone with their own struggles, but here are some things I feel are very important and we should all remember:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Be patient with yourself and others. This is important. Try and understand rather than argue or criticise.&nbsp;</li><li>We need to show more empathy, compassion and respect. Pointlessly criticising, dismissing others’ sadness as comparatively less than yours, gossiping and meanness disguised as ‘banter’ needs to be unlearnt.&nbsp;</li><li>Just listen. Don’t try to compare with your own experiences or try to relate by bringing in your own stories as this can shift the focus away from what’s important and who’s important. Just listen.</li><li>A person’s silence speaks volumes. Stop worrying about coming across as annoying or nosey and send that message of ‘how are you doing’ or ‘been missing you, how about we call tomorrow’</li><li>You probably won’t get an honest response straight away from someone who is not doing great, so use your judgement. Not everyone will feel like sharing but let them know you genuinely care. Don’t force someone to talk, but are they just staying quiet because they don’t want to inconvenience you?&nbsp;</li><li>Of course, we all have our own lives and are busy with our own stuff, but if someone’s absence and their silence has been noticeable or out of character or there’s been signs in the past that maybe their mental health isn’t the best &#8211; it’s time to drop them a message.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m not saying I’m perfect at recognising when someone needs me. In fact, I’m impatient, moody and short-tempered. I myself have a long way to go, so this article reminds me to be better and holds me accountable just as much as it does others. We all need to be better. We all need to be kinder and more understanding. Don’t worry, we are all in the ‘be better’ boat together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Some useful links and resources:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If anyone’s struggling, contact <a href=\"https://www.samaritans.org/support-us/fundraising-appeals/hope-search/?version=emergencyappeal-12&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwjer4BRCZARIsABK4QeUwy8VYh6i8t8EfpC9c1ME878Uyuu4_x43EYhNObBMOxlCsXK0YLUAaAhHDEALw_wcB\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Samaritans</a> on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">LinkedIn was originally designed to be a professional networking site; a platform where firms can seek out new talent, and where virtual schmoozing can earn you brownie points with potential future employers (“<em>Extremely thought-provoking read, Mark! I love your take on holistic strategies to develop synergies and promoting vertical growth within your Big Bad Corporation!”). </em>Despite not typically being lumped in with sites like Instagram and Facebook, it is undoubtedly a form of social media, and as such a breeding ground for unrealistic expectations and unhealthy comparisons – especially among insecure, 20-something year old recent graduates. Considering today&#8217;s glorified hustle culture, it may do more harm than good for those of us who might still be trying to figure things out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A friend once said to me, “You know you’re getting old when you start stalking people on LinkedIn instead of Facebook”. And indeed, the end of university typically marks the beginning of the LinkedIn era. From now on, one’s online presence is integral to the personal brand you would like to sell to potential future employers. In light of this, Instagram accounts are made private and Facebook names mysteriously change to barely pronounceable, spoonerized jumbles of accented letters (Alex Smith turns into Šåłëx Âmïth etc.). All this is done to remain elusive to nosy HR managers on any form of social media other than your meticulously crafted LinkedIn profile. The boozy festival pictures you were happy to share with the world only a couple of months ago are silently deleted &#8211; God forbid your boss ever sifts through the underbelly of your online existence to find evidence of you <em>living your life like a normal person</em>…! As a young graduate you would like to convince your budding professional network that you were always a strapping young corporate lad with a pearly white smile and a squeaky-clean record.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where things get dangerous – especially for those with fragile <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/the-education-to-employment-transition-prioritising-your-mental-health/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">mental health</a>. LinkedIn, just like any other form of social media, invites comparison, which can quickly cause an already insecure graduate to veer off into a downward spiral of self-doubt and anxiety. In the months after graduating, where many find themselves trapped in some sort of limbo-life where they are forced to move back home and bum off their parents, while fruitlessly sending out job applications, it can be incredibly frustrating to have the stellar CVs and job updates from peers at your fingertips. It is easy to lose sight of the fact that, just like Instagram is the highlight reel of one’s personal life, LinkedIn is merely the highlight reel of one’s academic and professional life. Comparing your own successes to the LinkedIn version of someone else is about as pointless as comparing an unflattering bikini shot of yourself after eating a 7-course meal with Kylie Jenner’s most recent professionally orchestrated, nipped, tucked and photoshopped semi-nude Instagram post. There is no way of knowing how many of the coveted internships someone may have listed on their LinkedIn were preceded by rejections, or how many of them were actually sponsored by nepotism over actual talent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My point is: it is important to remind yourself that the most flattering version of a person is almost never the most honest version. One must only look at the “about me” sections to make this laughably obvious. Here, those openly misogynistic ex-rugby lads with “beer and bitches” in their Facebook bios are suddenly selling themselves as “passionate, self-motivated and<strong> </strong>results-orientated team player(s) with excellent interpersonal skills”. LinkedIn undeniably invites a complete whitewashing of one’s personality. Most bios are littered with the same top 10 LinkedIn <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/06/these-are-the-top-10-buzzwords-on-linkedin.html\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">buzzwords</a> &#8211; probably copped at a “Business Networking 101” campus workshop &#8211; weaved around some vague, vacuous sentence. A smattering of business lingo here, a dash of false confidence there and a whole lot of bullshit. People tend to write the type of things they think employers would want to hear. The type of stuff that will get their metaphorical tails wagging. “Big data…Growth hacking…cutting edge…”. Instant salivation: A variation of the Pavlov effect, if you will. Whether or not the bio actually applies to the person is completely irrelevant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More important than the mendacious bios, which are admittedly more of a pet peeve of mine, is that LinkedIn perpetuates today’s highly competitive and fast paced hustle culture, which can take a toll on one’s psychological wellbeing. In our society, being constantly busy is equated to being successful. Employers frown upon gaps on the CV. Internships or periods of employment should be back to back, as anything else would imply laziness and a lack of direction or ambition. And so, it is easy to idealise those peers that constantly seem to be “doing stuff”. Yet, no one ever thinks to look beyond an impressive job title, despite the fact that more often than not a lonely, stressed and anxious individual is hiding behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you take anything away from this, I want it to be not to reduce people to their online presence. Whatever you see on paper is never the full story, so don’t bother comparing yourself. I know LinkedIn can quickly make you feel like everyone else is speeding past you in the fast lane to making millions and finding professional fulfilment, while you are ambling along in a dishevelled Ford with a broken satnav – But this is usually not the case. Most people are clueless and drifting to a degree, they might just be better at hiding it.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Clara Meyer-Horn</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Rate and comment on this article </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Write for us: <a href=\"mailto:stories@herdcommunity.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stories@herdcommunity.co.uk</a></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/clarameyer-horn/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7d17b45d6fe92d69245e50d8085e524e?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Clara Meyer-Horn\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/clarameyer-horn/\">Clara Meyer-Horn</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

There is, however, something that has not changed – the growing problem of resistant bacteria, and the continuing failure of Western Medicine to explore the solutions. Half medicinal, half political &#8211; welcome to the world of resistant microbes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coronavirus has shown us all how vulnerable we can be to infections. As a novel virus, we lack any kind of immunity to it and as a result it will infect such a huge proportion of the global population that, despite the <em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01738-2\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">low fatality rate</a></span></em>, millions of lives will be lost to the virus. However, once the virus has infected most people it will enter the seasonal flu cycle as another strain of flu-causing <em><a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiaa345/5860444\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">coronavirus</span></a></em>. This will contribute a low number of deaths every year to our annual flu totals. Coronavirus is so disruptive to us because it has only this year evolved. After this, it will become progressively weaker, with its symptoms gradually weakening over time. This is called attenuation, and while it is not fully understood in nature it is the backbone of modern <em><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC136581/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">vaccine research</span></a></em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what about Bacteria? Bacteria are very different to Virions. They are a hugely diverse group of organisms which includes many healthy or benign microbes – the probiotics in your morning <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4045285/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Yoghurt</em></span></a>, for instance, can add to the variety of <em><a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/361/bmj.k2179\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">healthy bacteria</span></a></em> in your gut – these little guys are key to gut health, and bacteria have similar positive effects throughout the body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While viruses are little more than a shell containing genetic material (a sort of ‘Bio-torpedo’), Bacteria are their very own cells. They can survive and replicate outside of human cells and, as a result, they can be a far larger problem for our immune systems. Even in Covid-19 cases, it is often not the virus itself that kills you but a co-infection by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC127765/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">opportunistic</span></em></a> bacteria, which infect the cells in the lungs after the virus has eaten away the protective lining around them. Bacteria replicate outside of your cells and in the case of Covid-19 they do so in the tiniest airways of your lungs. They can also replicate in your blood vessels, your body cavities, and your mouth for example. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is bad for us because the infection is not contained within your cells. Your immune system must use a more ‘broad-spectrum’ set of defences. Take pneumonia for example, which can be caused by either type of microbe and is <em><a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/64061-bacterial-pneumonia-heart-health.html\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">much more</span></a></em> dangerous when it is bacterial. This is due to something called <em>Inflammation.</em> Inflammation is its own topic, but it is best characterised as the kind of soreness you experience with a cut or an infection. Bacteria cause more of this throughout the cavities of the body, which stresses your immune system far more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know how antibiotics work, and we all know they only kill bacteria. Many of them kill bacteria so well in fact that they cause serious collateral <em><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6511407/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">damage</span></a></em> to the healthy bacteria in your body as well. They’re so powerful that full courses of well prescribed antibiotics have effectively eliminated bacterial disease and significantly <em><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5354621/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">lengthened</span></a></em> our lifespans. They have been used – and misused – so widely, so loosely, and so excessively however that we may well lose them altogether. How is this possible?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bacteria evolve around our antibiotics when they are given enough exposure to do so – the stragglers which remain when a patient skips half of their course, or the exposure in patients who are given antibiotics they do not need. Agriculture in particular is a huge contributor to the problem. Livestock around the world – particularly in the US and China – are pumped full of antibiotics, creating <em><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924857900003010\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">huge pools</span></a></em> of resistant bacteria. We know that bacterial resistance <em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-018-1109-4\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rises with more</a></span></em> antibiotics, and it falls with less. Yet, usage of the drugs <em><a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/news/medication/global-antibiotic-use-has-increased-sparking-fears-worldwide-resistance/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">continues to increase</span></a></em> and the costs of treating resistant infections like MRSA continue to rise, already costing us <em><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4159373/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">billions</span></a></em> of pounds in healthcare. On top of all of this, no new antibiotics have been developed in <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2012.00238/full#B10\"><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">over 30 years</span></em></a>. However, there is a solution. And this is where the politics comes in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bacteriophage are viruses which only infect bacteria. They are incredibly specific to their target, with most phage only infecting one species of bacteria. They have been shown to <em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/5/3/806/htm\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">co-evolve</a></span></em> with the bacteria they kill even inside our bodies, which would permanently solve the problem of resistance. Phage could be <em><a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/31b8/815847136af7ea2258f6d93157594ee151ca.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">cheaper</span></a></em> than antibiotics once established as a treatment and it can act <em><a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/femsle/article/287/2/185/527044\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">alongside</span></a></em> antibiotics to kill resistant strains such as MRSA. The list of benefits from phage therapy is long and exciting, and yet the Western Literature has only recently begun to look into them. Why is this? Why don’t we use them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, Phage therapies have been used in Poland <em><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123944382000037\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">for decades</span></a></em>. As far back as the 1920s, in fact. Phage therapies developed in the Soviet Union in the early twentieth century as Western countries developed antibiotics. The two sides did not share much research and focussed on their respective techniques. Indeed, in the 1940s the Soviets produced <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123944382000013\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">a litany</span></em></a> of research on phage in various fields of medicine. This research is not perfect, but it is surely enough to warrant attention. The West, misguided by the mindset of the new Cold War, chose to abandon phage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even Now, the FDA is hesitant to approve phage therapies. Phage are specific, and cocktails of different phage must be used to treat most infections. Hesitation to adopt Soviet technology and a longstanding FDA opposition to cocktail therapies continues to frustrate attempts to invite American healthcare dollars into phage research. Though, this will not be the case forever, with novel technologies being looked at and a few FDA <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt1206-1508\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Approvals</span></em></a> of phage therapy (though few and far between).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the times of the pandemic, it is important not to forget the other invisible enemy and, perhaps even more importantly, how politics can influence how we look at science, sometimes to our detriment.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By David Haigh</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><strong>Rate and comment on this article below!</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Write for us: <a href=\"mailto:stories@herdcommunity.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stories@herdcommunity.co.uk</a></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/davidhaigh/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/db8a009b37d9526360197bd9f85d0138?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"David Haigh\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/davidhaigh/\">David Haigh</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In 1997, when Britain completed its hand over of Hong Kong to China, it was done under the promise that China would uphold the “One Country, Two System” concept, which essentially established Hong Kong as an autonomous region. However, with the new National Security Bill, this concept seems to have been firmly consigned to the past. The controversial new law is aimed at halting “secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements” that may endanger China’s “national security”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Separatism is often cited by the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as justification for the suppression of any opposition. This new bill means that the protests that have defined Hong Kong for the last year are now deemed illegal in the eyes of the CCP, and those breaking this new law risk life in prison. Calling for an independent Hong Kong now falls under “secession”, and vandalizing public property, as some protesters did last year, is now seen as an act of terrorism. Protests have almost completely stopped, political groups have disbanded, and social media accounts have been cleaned. The language used in the bill is malleable, meaning that it can easily be applied to a range of situations. Police have cracked down on potential ‘secessionists&#8217; throughout the country, going so far as to arrest suspects aboard airplanes shortly before take-off. The few that still try to protest have turned to more subtle means, including holding blank sheets of white paper in the streets to avoid being accused of having a ‘separatist attitude&#8217;. In the last year alone, 29,900 people left Hong Kong, and shortly after the new law was announced in June pro-democracy activists, such as Nathan Law, moved overseas for fear of their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the uncertainty caused around the COVID-19 outbreak, it appears to be an ideal time to rush through such a significant bill with minimal disruption. A fresh spike in coronavirus cases in Hong Kong in the last few days has also prompted another lockdown across the region, meaning that those who were already risking everything in order to protest the new law are once again being rushed back inside in the name of public health. It was also passed the day before the anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover from Britain to China, and therefore can be taken as a signal that the CCP ultimately consider themselves as the ones to determine Hong Kong’s fate, as it belongs to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The international response has been strong. The director of Amnesty UK, Kate Allen, labelled it as an “outrageous attack on human rights”. She believes that the law has “laid steadfast foundations for repression, political silence and far-reaching fear”, and that “it is imperative that the international community wakes up to the alarming situation that lies before them – China has shown that it can be swayed if it is put under strong and sustained pressure”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the eyes of Britain, the new law breaks the Sino-British declaration of “One Country-Two Systems”. In a statement issued shortly after the new bill was announced, Boris Johnson said that the people of Hong Kong felt that their way of life “is under threat” and that “if China proceeds to justify their fears, then Britain could not in good conscience shrug our shoulders and walk away; instead we will honour our obligations and provide an alternative”. This has been seen with the extension of immigration rights to Hong Kong residents, including making a further 2.5 million people eligible to apply for a British National Overseas Passport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other countries, such as the United States and Taiwan, have also offered to extend visas to Hong Kong residents. Australia has suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong, and the Prime Minister Scott Morrison has gone so far as to encourage businesses to relocate to Australia. With the upcoming election in the United States, Trump has a political incentive to return to the populist anti-China sentiment that he successfully used in 2016. In making China a political scapegoat, it could gain him some much-needed ground back in the November election, and this new bill provides him a fresh opportunity to attack, as seen by the rejection of China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, and the suspension trading with Hong Kong. Boris Johnson’s recent rejection of Huawei’s involvement in the development of the UK’s 5G network is evidently linked to pressure from Trump and the sanctions he imposed on the telecoms company.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ten years ago, China was being hailed as the future. This was perhaps best highlighted with the Beijing Olympic Games, which was an impressive spectacle showing China at its best, and seemingly cemented its place as a world leader. Even in 2015, former Chancellor George Osbourne was calling it the “golden decade” of Sino-British relations. However, in the current climate, China’s future in the global community is undoubtedly questionable. Not only has its actions in Hong Kong drawn widespread criticism, but the reports of horrendous human rights abuses and mass incarceration of the Uyghur people and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang region have prompted an international backlash against China’s growing influence in the world. Hardening attitudes against China in the past couple of years have been evident, and the international response to Hong Kong’s new security bill, in addition to conspiracy theories around the origin of the coronavirus and the rejection of Huawei, are all evidence of this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, with the coronavirus crisis, there has already been a reordering of the global balance of power. COVID-19 has torn the United States apart, and protests about long-term racial injustices have further exacerbated the situation. With America’s weakened position, China has seen an opportunity, as shown with their territory grabs, as well as bringing Hong Kong under its umbrella. It is also seen in their reaction to the international response to the new bill. China has been pedalling a narrative that the West is behind the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, and claim that countries such as the USA want to cause unrest in order to hinder China on its rise to world superpower status. They have labelled actions such as Australia’s highlighted above as “gross interference” in its domestic activities, and even issued a statement urging them to “stop meddling … otherwise it will lead to nothing but lifting a rock only to hit its own feet”. An editorial in Chinese state media recently said that the UK must suffer “public and painful” retaliation for its rejection of Huawei, and described it as a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/china-painful-and-public-retaliation-uk-huawei-hong-kong-2020-7\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">“weak link”</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though Britain has rejected Huawei, in the post-Brexit world Boris will be keen to forge new economic relations with big trading partners, especially China. Therefore, it is unknown how far Britain will really go in attempting to curtail <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/china-in-focus/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Chinese</a> influence. While in the past China was swayed “under strong and sustained pressure” from the international community, it is uncertain whether past methods will have the same effect as the West attempts to recover from the domestic upheaval caused by COVID-19 and underlying racial injustices.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>By Geo<em>rgia Angela</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Comment and rate this article below!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Write for us: <a href=\"mailto:stories@herdcommunity.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stories@herdcommunity.co.uk</a></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/georgiaangela/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2ae2c2b0d05f3fa9575ace8223284642?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Georgia Angela\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/georgiaangela/\">Georgia Angela</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Du Bois once described the Atlantic Slave Trade as the “most magnificent drama of the last thousand years of human history,” so why are these historical atrocities absent from modern depictions of pirates?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During recent campaigns for British <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/a-brief-history-of-british-colonialism-and-its-contemporary-repercussions/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">colonialism</a> to be included in the educational syllabus and the current controversy of white actors taking black roles in film and television, one of the highest grossing film franchises of all time announced a reboot. <em>The Pirates of the Caribbean </em>series has grossed $4.5 billion dollars worldwide. However, despite its global reach, the series refuses to reflect its global audience, nor recognise the history it draws from. Instead, this pirate’s franchise perpetuates myths of white exceptionalism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a western tradition of painting over the cracks of imperial history, of indifference, when it comes to the unforgivable actions of the British Empire during the Golden Age of Piracy. In 1729, Lord Chamberlain refused to licence <em>Polly</em>, John Gay’s sequel to <em>The Beggars Opera,</em> censoring one of the most successful events of the period and restricting an accurate depiction of the reality of black pirates. Fast-forward to 2007 and the third film in the series, <em>Pirates of the Caribbean At World’s End, </em>becomes the highest grossing film of the year. A scene in which the morality of the slave trade is discussed was cut from the theatrical release, echoing the censorship that occurred nearly 300 years ago when it deleted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course nobody was expecting a nuanced discussion on the arbitrary brutality of the Trans Atlantic slave trade from a movie based on an amusement park ride – and nor should they. There is a time and place for this discussion and a family-friendly film should not have to sacrifice its escapism. However, setting a film in say, the Caribbean, and only having black actors cast in supporting roles plays into the “Single Story” dilemma proposed by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. For many, this will be the only cultural depiction of the Caribbean or of the time period that they will be exposed to, and what is the underlying subconscious message they will be receiving? White pirates went on ludicrous adventures whilst being pursued by those uptight colonisers!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The least a film series titled, <em>The Pirates of the Caribbean, </em>could do is provide a substantial representation of actors of Caribbean descent. After all, the world of pirates has been described as “A mix’t multitude of all country’s”, Black Sam Bellamy’s infamous crew of 1717 contained a crew of two-dozen Africans liberated from a slave ship along with other nationalities. Other ships of the time were described as being ‘Half <em>French, </em>half Negroes”. Then there are true accounts of the mutiny aboard the slave ship <em>Gambia Castle</em>, which was renamed <em>Delivery </em>and the folklore legends of Black Caesar, the African pirate to draw from. Instead, the most successful pirate franchise delegated Afro-Caribbean male roles to those of intimidating, laconic henchmen, such as “Bo’sun” Barbossa’s First Mate in <em>The Curse of the Black Pearl</em> whose name roughly translates to boat servant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Afro-Caribbean females fare a little better in this series, such as the female captain of the first film, Anamaria (played by Zoe Salanda) who is inexplicably dropped from this minor screen role by the second film. The most prominent role given to an actor of Caribbean heritage is the spectacular Naomi Harris, who plays Tia Dalma, the Voodoo Queen. However this role is in itself problematic. She seems to exist as an atavistic trope of the magical black character that supports the white protagonist, as observed by Spike Lee. Tia Dalma is introduced to the audience at her residence, a haven for escaped slaves; an interesting but fleeting acknowledgement to the period setting, the encircling history that surrounds each film, threatens to break and reveal a more interesting plot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the fourth film, the infamous pirate Blackbeard, as played by Ian McShane, has transformed his crew into Zombies using the “Dark Arts” in another culturally insensitive decision from the series. Haitian folklore was the cultural birthplace of the Zombie and the legend goes that humans could be controlled by a sorcerer called a “Bokor” who uses them for his own ends, often menial work &#8211; a fitting analogy for the slave trade. This was later appropriated by Hollywood during the American occupation of Haiti who re-represented Zombies to become more threatening as highlighted in the 1932 film <em>White Zombie, </em>where a white plantation owner is threatened by a Zombie. To draw a comparison between the modern motion pictures’ vision of a flesh-eating Zombie and the origin would be virtue-signalling, but it is worth noting that the film reverts back to the master-slave dynamic of Zombie folklore for Blackbeard’s crew who were 60% black by 1717, a fact that clearly is not represented in the casting of the film.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another damaging trope the series entertains is that of the flesh-eating savage. The link between skin colour, flesh-eating myths and white peril is complex. Black pirates were accused of being flesh-eating savages in white newspapers, and the stereotype of the flesh-eating other is shown at the start of the second film, <em>Dead Man’s Chest, </em>in which Jack Sparrow (played by Johnny Depp) and his predominantly white crew are at risk of being eaten by these savages. Moreover this sequence was filmed on Dominica, a Caribbean country that was colonised and used to import slaves. Interestingly, the pirates who do not make it off the island alive are not majority white. Whether consciously or not, the film’s projection of images of white exceptionalism and distortion of history can further entrench racist misconceptions of the past.The franchise need not be cancelled, but with a reboot on the horizon, this huge platform can and should do better. It is not just this franchise that perpetuates these myths, rather this is just an easy example with plenty of material to choose from. Pick any modern pirate television show, from <em>Crossbones </em>to <em>Black Sails</em>, and see the near-all white cast. Watch the predominantly white cast of <em>Horrible Histories </em>teach you about piracy, have playable black pirates included only as “extra content” in the best selling <em>Assassins Creed Black Flag </em>pirate video game and you will soon arrive at a false conclusion. ‘The most dramatic event of human history’ has become but a footnote to these fun, white pirates who ruled the seas.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By James Doherty</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Rate and comment on this article below!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Write for us: <a href=\"mailto:stories@herdcommunity.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stories@herdcommunity.co.uk</a></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/jamesdoherty/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ec5c6f723b0dcfa4902b218eca7f2a7e?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"James Doherty\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/jamesdoherty/\">James Doherty</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Ask them how they are feeling about what they have seen or heard. Reassure them that it is ok to be confused or to not understand what is happening.</li><li>Have a conversation – discuss the different points of view, explain a little about some of the injustices suffered by Black people in our country and elsewhere. You might want to talk about the death of Stephen Lawrence, South African apartheid, or the history of slavery – all in an age-appropriate way that reveals enough information to inform but not disturb your child.</li><li>What happened to George Floyd may appear rare but, sadly, it is a repeated offence committed by some police officers against Black people. Reassure your child that, just as not every person is a burglar, not every police officer is violent and racist. George Floyd’s death is also a sad consequence of hundreds of years of inequality, unfairness and oppression of Black people by white people. The protests we have seen are expressing anger and frustration at the ongoing inequality and unfair treatment of some sections of our society.</li><li>Say that ‘some people’ feel a certain way about others, and that it is unfair of them to make judgements because of an aspect of their identity. You can bring this into a child’s perspective by suggesting an allegory – perhaps of only brown-eyed children being allowed to play on equipment in the park, or of only tall people having the right to sit on public benches. This can help to point out the ridiculousness and unfairness of making these distinctions. </li><li>Don’t claim to have all the answers. Children need to understand that it is an extremely complex issue that will not be solved overnight. Many racist attitudes and biases are the product of upbringing and a sense of “That’s how it’s always been”. In society, racial bias is slow to change and can affect minority groups deeply.  It is hard for people to let go of this and start thinking differently.  But everyone taking a stand and considering their own unconscious (or conscious) bias will help to improve the social climate and create a fairer world for everyone.</li><li>Resolve with your child to keep the conversation open and work together to be people who will not accept racist attitudes. You might like to create a pledge that can be put on the fridge to say that you will not tolerate racist attitudes, jokes, speech or actions in your home as a reminder to yourselves and visitors of how you want to eradicate racism.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no doubt that children pick up on many more things they see and hear than we ever know about, especially when an incident like the recent events in the USA reverberate around the world. However, being able to talk to them about issues such as racism and other Hate Crimes is a really important step to help them build a positive attitude to diversity and understand why discrimination is wrong and causes so much pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Stop Hate UK</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stop Hate UK is one of the leading national organisations working to challenge all forms of Hate Crime and discrimination. <strong><a href=\"http://stop%20hate%20uk%20is%20one%20of%20the%20leading%20national%20organisations%20working%20to%20challenge%20all%20forms%20of%20hate%20crime%20and%20discrimination/\">Visit their website</a></strong> or follow them on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/stop_hate_uk/\"><strong>Instagram</strong></a> to stay up the date with their continuing work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stop Hate UK wrote an article considering how younger people may approach talking to parents about racism: <strong><a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/tips-on-talking-to-parents-about-racism/\">check it out here</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>You can donate to Stop Hate UK here: <a href=\"http://www.stophateuk.org/donate-to-stop-hate-uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">http://www.stophateuk.org/donate-to-stop-hate-uk/</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Give the article a rating below!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Write for us: <a href=\"mailto:stories@herdcommunity.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stories@herdcommunity.co.uk</a></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/stophateuk/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/67626242f590389d1109ff5a90a0d40a?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Stop Hate UK\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/stophateuk/\">Stop Hate UK</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

We follow them on social media, depend on them for perceiving worth and go to them for entertainment. With branding everywhere from our screens to our bus stops and, as servers of the consumer, they have a responsibility to represent their customers, to encourage diversity, demonstrate solidarity and support those from minority groups.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amidst the Black Lives Matter movement, every brand on my Instagram and Twitter feed were posting about how they support Black people’s rights, including L’Oréal, Facebook and Vogue. But do they really? Fashion brands such as Topshop, Urban Outfitters and Kendall + Kylie claim to support people of colour whilst failing to pay Bangladeshi workers for their work during the pandemic. These workers are not covered by government financial aid schemes and have done hours of unpaid labour just because Kylie Jenner wants her billionaire label. Billionaire and owner of Topshop, Philip Green, is bathing in his wealth on his luxury superyacht posting #blacklivesmatter but does not care that hundreds of his employees who are people of colour cannot afford to eat tonight because he refuses pay a sum that would hardly dent his worth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spanish women’s fashion brand, Gimagaus, had me boycott buying from them. They did ‘their bit’ for BLM, posted a picture of young black boys and said that sales from one of their dresses was going to a charity combatting racism in Barcelona. Although this is a step in the right direction, the only black faces I could see scrolling through their Instagram page were those black boys which frankly have nothing to do with a womenswear brand. After messaging them about the lack of black representation on their page, they proceeded to send me screenshots of models of colour they had used, all of whom were very fair skinned mixed-race models who do not represent dark skinned beauty but rather resemble the tanned white models they use. After reiterating how they need to represent the dark-skinned community they responded by saying they were ‘looking for ways to support this matter’ yet continued to post pictures of skinny white girls for their next 30 posts. As a brand who sources inspiration from the ‘<a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/gimaguas-spanish-fashion-accessories-label-summer-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>exotic</em></span></a>’, it seems as though they are yet another brand who exploit POC’s culture for their ‘exotic’ look branded for white girls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the lack of solidarity does not stop there. Weeks after George Floyd’s death black, trans activist, model and DJ Munroe Bergdorf criticised L’Oréal for dropping her from their campaign after she posted a 3-part video about how racism is a social structure which makes white people racist. Facebook deleted her post as it ‘breached its terms on hate speech’, yet Facebook fails to take down thousands of racist and transphobic posts and comments every day, including the trolling that she receives. L’Oréal, after Bergdorf publicly outed them, have apologetically hired her to be a part of their diversity and inclusion advisory board. It is a shame that this would never have happened had it not been for Bergdorf holding L’Oréal accountable for their hypocrisy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instagram are no better (seeing as they are owned by Facebook). Ahead of Pride weekend, Instagram changed its logo to rainbow colours and posted queer people’s stories showing their ‘solidarity’ for the LGBTQ+ community. Yet, when myself and hundreds of others reported @<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/coreissuestrusttv/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">coreissuestrusttv</a>’s account for their hate speech, they responded by telling me to mute or unfollow the account instead as it ‘likely doesn’t go against [their] community guidelines’. This so-called Christian account’s bio says they “focus on issues of homosexuality, challenging gender confusion and upholding science and conscience.” First of all, The Bible and Science contradict each other on most pages so they should probably educate themselves on some science first. Secondly, the only confusion or lack of conscience happening is theirs and that of their followers. They proudly post videos and pictures of ‘x-lesbians’, ‘x-LGBT supporters’, ‘x-trans people’, saying how they helped end their ‘identity crisis’ and gave them ‘the freedom to choose’, when really they have taken away their freedom and manipulated human nature by unhealthily and unnaturally brainwashing them. I could write pages about this homophobic and regressive page but that is for a different article. Instagram cannot claim to support queer people but not condone hate speech and homophobic propaganda. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vogue have also faced fire from the amount of accounts of racism that co-workers experienced when working for Condé Nast. The same goes for Anthropologie (owned by Urban Outfitters), where ex-workers exposed their use of a code word that they would use when a black person entered the shop. The list goes on and it is unacceptable that these brands put on a face of solidarity and allyship whilst concentrating little to no energy into actually improving their standards unless when under fire by the public via the media. There are a number of good brands such as Ben &amp; Jerry’s and Adidas who have stopped advertising with Facebook over their incapacity to stop hate speech after Twitter succeeded on calling out Trump for his lies and racism. We need brands to be as transparent and supportive as they claim to be, to accept their mistakes instead of hiding them and to want to learn and improve as the battle for equality still has a long way to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/jemimacompton/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">By Jemima Compton</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Write for us: <a href=\"mailto:stories@herdcommunity.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stories@herdcommunity.co.uk</a></em></h2>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/jemimacompton/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ba731663e0b7eb27a776edaa69e4b37c?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Jemima Compton\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/jemimacompton/\">Jemima Compton</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

It is safe to say that during Covid-19 every one of us in one way or another has experienced loss. Some albeit more than others, there is a strong sense across the country &#8211; even the world &#8211; that we are all experiencing the different <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/withnail-and-isolation-five-stages-of-lockdown-as-told-by-the-cult-classic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stages</a> of a global pandemic… together. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The series of emotions goes like this; denial, anger, depression, bargaining and finally, acceptance. The accuracy of this model is thought to be outdated and has lost its credibility to many scientists who believe it to be entirely unhelpful in dealing with loss. However, when it comes to a global pandemic it seems rather fitting. Since the beginning of the year we have lost loved ones, jobs, independence, the rhythm of a normal routine and speaking for myself – on occasion – my mind. So how are we dealing with not only our own worlds, but the world as a whole turning upside down? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Denial, the first stage of Kubler-Ross’s model. <em>It won’t happen to me, it won’t happen to my family. It will pass in a few weeks. </em>Most of us thought this, right? Denial comes from fear, the fear of the unknown, the fear of what’s to come. Having seen what happened in countries weeks before us, the idea of what was coming was incredibly scary… and thus ignored. In the stages of grief this is where people cling to an alternative reality, convinced it simply isn’t happening. Delving into the world of lockdown, drinking at 12pm on a Wednesday and doing your seventh quiz of the week became the new-norm. We rejected the idea and rejoiced in wearing the same pyjamas for five days straight. When we recognised that denial couldn’t continue – that this <em>Covid-stuff</em> is real &#8211; the second stage materialized.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anger. If you’re anything like me you’ve tried to forget those few weeks of absolute panic where our country turned into a post-apocalyptic, loo-roll lacking society hoarding pasta and baked beans with a cap on how much we can buy at the super-market<em>. Those were the days…</em> Anger sparked and many of us became dinner table pandemic experts. Every conversation was about how we’ve done it all wrong, if the economy will survive and what we <em>think </em>should have happened. For the slightly more motivated anger gave rise to adrenaline and home workouts boomed. Joe Wicks became a prodigy. However, the biggest emotional response to anger is finding someone to condemn. You only had to watch the news for five minutes to see our politicians throwing blame around like a game of hot potato. We wanted answers and we wanted them now! When we didn’t receive them anger turned to depression, the third stage of grief.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depression. For many of us those workouts stopped, the quizzes (finally) came to an end and enthusiasm for the indoors slowly declined. People were getting restless and bored,&nbsp; Houseparty dried up quicker than the hose-pipe bans and the UK faced a lull. This was the hard part, the part where if you didn’t have a garden you resented those that did. Suddenly nature and the outside world became a curious, treasured place. The one hour exercise window became the most important part of the day. It was in this stage that mother nature flourished. Without us she thrived and suddenly the classic saying “clear blue skies without a cloud insight” became “clear blue skies without a plane insight.” With pollen reaching its highest count in 70 years it felt as though the environment was reclaiming what once was theirs – <em>nature</em>. The fourth stage of grief runs parallel to depression and with depression you get bargaining.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bargaining. In the global pandemic’s case, bargaining comes in all shapes and sizes. For many of us this was <em>if I can’t have freedom I’ll have this instead </em>which has been a blessing for Jeff Bezos who finds himself 24 billion dollars better-off than before the pandemic. Bargaining aids unnecessary purchases and in many cases people in their twenties are experiencing the classic mid-life-crisis-equals-buy-a-motorbike ordeal. But hey, why not? If not now then when, right? This is the stage where we question and barter. Do we have to go back to an office, and if not, can we do this instead? Eventually through bargaining and discovering a new-normal, learning to cope and adjusting to change we find ourselves in the final stage, acceptance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Acceptance. For many of us this is creating pandemic resolutions and sticking to them or realising you haven’t spent the last three months becoming a yoga hotshot like you said you would in March but knowing that <em>that’s ok.</em> Learning that keeping yourself safe is the key to keeping others safe. Making plans for the future and realising you’re not alone in feeling slightly lost and unprepared for what’s to come. Learning that there’s a hell of a lot more going on in our world than just this pandemic and that <em>things need to change. </em>With acceptance there comes a sense of hope, we can’t change what’s happened but we can work together to change the future. So whatever stage you’re in, good luck – you’ve got this. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Sophie Gilbert</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Write for us: <a href=\"mailto:stories@herdcommunity.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stories@herdcommunity.co.uk</a></em></h2>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/sophiegilbert/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/aea88acfc27eb1ed5b2e761a500397ca?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Sophie Gilbert\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/sophiegilbert/\">Sophie Gilbert</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

On the surface, West checks off all the initial boxes needed to become President of the United States. He is a natural-born citizen from birth, at least 35 years old, and has been a resident of the U.S. for over 14 years. But unfortunately for the Jesus Is King artist, there are more hurdles and rules that he’ll need to pass before his name ends up on the ballot on November 3rd. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After making his bombshell announcement via Twitter, West sat down with <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbespr/2020/07/08/kanye-west-reveals-presidential-platform-in-exclusive-interview-with-forbes/#4a3af1f16305\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Forbes</a> Magazine and outlined what exactly his campaign, and the White House, would look like under President West. The rapper and producer, who registered to vote a week ago, in summary, is pro-life, has no foreign policy mapped out, and has said he is suspicious of a coronavirus vaccine. West also added that he plans to run the White House on the Wakanda management model (yes, the fictitious country from the Marvel movie Black Panther).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A lot of Africans do not like the movie [Black Panther] and representation of themselves in…Wakanda,” West told Forbes, “But I’m gonna use the framework of Wakanda right now because it’s the best explanation of what our design group is going to feel like in the White House.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also revealed in the interview that his running mate will be Michelle Tidball, a preacher from Wyoming who has described herself as a “biblical life coach” and said he would focus on ending police brutality and is against the death penalty. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There has been speculation on whether West running is a PR move to promote his new album, but the artist has denied that his possible campaign is a publicity stunt and that he is serious about running for president. That being said, what exactly would it take for West’s name to show up on the ballot in November?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Officially, since his announcement on July 4th, he has 30 days to make a final decision about running for president. In the U.S., there are a few ways you can run for president. You can run on the Democratic ticket which Joe Biden is doing. You can run on the Republican ticket which Donald Trump is doing. You can run as on the independent ticket, or you can write yourself in, which is still not allowed in several states. West told Forbes earlier this week that he would run as a Republican if Trump wasn’t there and as an Independent if Trump is there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since it doesn’t look like Trump is going anywhere, West will probably run as an independent. However, there is the fact that he already missed the filing deadline to appear on the ballot in several states such as New York, North Carolina, and Texas. Also, an independent presidential candidate must petition for placement on the general election ballot in all 50 states as well as Washington D.C. Some states may allow an independent candidate to pay a filing fee instead of submitting a petition. In California, where West lives, the signature requirement is 196,964 and the deadline is August 7th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn’t the first time West has thought about sitting in the Oval Office. Before announcing his candidacy on Twitter, West had previously hinted that he was interested in running in 2024. But ultimately, West said the decision is up to God. “Let’s see if the appointing is at 2020 or if it’s 2024,” West said, “Because God appoints the president. If I win in 2020 then it was God’s appointment. If I win in 2024 then that was God’s appointment.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also doesn’t appear that the incumbent, President Trump, is too concerned about West as an opponent for November, and said in an interview with Real Clear Politics that Kanye West candidacy in 2020 would be a great trial run. “It’d have to be limited to certain states because in some states the deadline has been missed,” Trump said, “If he did it, he would have to view this as a trial run for what’s going to happen in four years.”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;When I’m president, let’s also have some fun&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, West plans to run under a new banner, the Birthday Party. “Because if we win,” West said, “it’s everybody’s birthday.” This is paired with his campaign slogan of “YES!” “Well, my second album is called Late Registration. I got a rap . . . The other thing is, my campaign is Kanye West YES, not YEP, not YEAH. YES. YES. YES. . . . When I’m president, let’s also have some fun. Let’s get past all the racism conversation, let’s empower people with 40 acres and a mule, let’s give some land, that’s the plan.” West said in his interview with Forbes. While his wife Kim Kardashian West hasn’t publicly made a statement on the announcement, West told Forbes that she is one of his advisors along with Elon Musk and that they have been talking about this for years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although West may not even show up on the ballot in the November election, many are concerned people will just vote for West as a joke, much like the Harambe for president campaign in 2016. Harambe, the gorilla at the Cincinnati Zoo that was shot and killed after a 3-year-old boy fell into his exhibit in May 2016, was rumored to have 11,000 to 15,000 votes in the 2016 Presidential Election. Although it was later proven that Harambe had nowhere near that many votes and that nine states in the U.S. don’t even allow write-ins at all voting in the U.S., and anywhere for that matter, is not a joke. And in such a contentious election year, voting has never been more important. It is also an important reminder that voting is not a constitutional right globally yet. In Saudi Arabia, women got the right to vote in 2015. And many countries, such as Kazakhstan, Iran, and China remain Anocracies – governments that are more authoritarian than democratic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If one thing has become clear out of all of this, it is that the term &#8216;celebrity&#8217; and &#8216;presidential candidate&#8217; have become interchangeable. Now, experienced politicians are becoming less and less trusted by the people, and celebrities think that having money earns you the right to run a country.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Olivia Eddy</em></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/oliviaeddy/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ec24fdb3da604d3005189b7366e28e1a?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Olivia Eddy\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/oliviaeddy/\">Olivia Eddy</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Phrases like ‘how’s quarantine going?’ have taken over our conversations with friends and family as a way of checking in, but mainly because we don’t really have anything else to talk about. For many people, this is the first time experiencing a quarantined lifestyle; in particular being cut off from friends and loved ones. The same, however, can’t be said for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In January 2018, I moved to France for a 6-month placement as part of my year abroad during university. After declining a job offer from a company in Paris upon finding out that it was unpaid (with a <em>café au lait</em> in Paris costing roughly €5.50, no one’s questioning that decision), I hurriedly accepted a job offer to work in St Malo, Brittany, a seasonal town best enjoyed in the rain-free months of July and August. Terrible timing from me but hey – I was desperate! You might be thinking “what kind of isolation occurs in a beautiful French town close to the seaside? What’s she got to complain about?!” – all I have to say is, buckle up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although my self-isolation in St Malo was not government ordered, my lifestyle became very similar to the rules we’re abiding by today: I went to work when I had to, I exercised once a day outside, and I didn’t see anyone outside of my household (not that I had the option to, being on the wrong side of the Channel and all). Much like cities such as San Francisco, where <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2020/03/16/san-francisco-coronavirus-lockdown-curfew-three-weeks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">curfews</a> have been put in place, I subconsciously created my own curfew. I was back from my exercise by 6pm, showered and eaten by 8pm. This gave me time to watch at least two episodes of Grey’s Anatomy predictably followed by one episode of New Girl (yes, I am intentionally plugging these shows, thank me later). When the weekend came around I would ‘treat myself’ to a glass of wine which, yes, did always end up being a bottle. Picture the opening scene of Bridget Jones, but replace the drunk singing of Jamie O’Neal’s ‘All By Myself’ to drunk giggling watching Mock the Week (again, you’re welcome). Before you know it, Monday would come around and the routine restarted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found it incredibly hard to meet people, the obvious route would be through work but they were all mothers of teenage kids. They were incredibly lovely women who made me feel very welcome, but it was like sitting in on my mum’s book club. Don’t get me wrong this is not a negative; who doesn’t love an excuse for friends to get together to eat nibbles and chat about a book that turns out most you haven’t actually read? I just missed talking to those of similar age to myself. Looking back on it now, I have never felt more alone or cut off from my friends and family than I did during those months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did have visitors, something up until a week ago we couldn’t benefit from in this lockdown; but I felt this was mainly to boost my morale rather than for their own benefit. A notable visit was that of my grandparents at the time of the 2018 Football <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/a-precious-moment-to-reflect-on-an-iconic-sporting-decade/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">World Cup</a>. Both my Grandparents are football mad, so we went to watch the England game in a local bar. Ironically, it was the first time I’d stepped foot in my ‘local’ &#8211; my previous efforts thwarted by a lack of confidence whilst being alone. Even whilst sporting a very out of place retro England shirt, my grandad befriended the owner in about 0.2 seconds. One more friend than I had made in the 5 months I had been there…infuriating!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This being said, before you readers leave this pity party that you have unintentionally attended (apologies by the way), there is a huge positive I have gained from my 2018 <em>Malouin</em> life that can be transferred to UK pandemic in 2020. What is this great new skill? The answer is an anticlimactic one; being able to find comfort in being on your own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you do this? Well, as a starting point I dedicated more time into researching the area surrounding me, in the hope of spending less time watching Friends reruns that I had already seen a million times; French Netflix is a dangerous place. I went on long walks and found cute, covey beaches, revisiting my favourites on a weekend equipped with an array of books. I even managed to finish Captain Corelli’s Mandolin, something that should be commended regardless of my situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also took myself out for dinner on regular occasions. I used to think that seeing someone dine alone was sad, but it’s incredibly liberating. No one cares that you’re there alone, <em>seriously,</em> no one is looking at you. The first time I did I took a book with me to put on the table, like a safety blanket, which I only picked up once right at the beginning. For the rest of my meal I people watched to my heart’s content whilst sipping on a lovely French red wine whilst waiting for my <em>entrecôte saignant</em> to arrive. Sophistication at its finest, I know. As the weather improved I started walking to work instead of driving, strolling through Saint Servan amongst the early risers and shop owners, and purposefully passing the bakery Ficelle et Chocolat whose mouth-watering smells of <em>pain</em> and <em>croissants</em> filled the street air. This may be incredibly cliché, but they need a mention as I single-handedly funded the patisserie’s production of <em>croissants almandes</em> during my 6-month stay. I tried to turn the feeling of being alone on its head, and used it as an opportunity to better know myself and change my attitude towards the situation I had found myself in. I mean, who needs mates when you’re in one of the best cider regions of France &#8211; practically a home away from home having come from Bristol and growing up on Thatcher’s Gold!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All jokes aside, I became used to my own company: looking after myself, finding and doing things that genuinely interested <em>me </em>and helped my mental wellbeing. I think there are many parallels that can be drawn between my time abroad and the lifestyle changes which this pandemic has inflicted upon so many people. Not being able to go anywhere, do anything, and see anyone is a pain, sure! No one’s doubting that. But for those that have been isolating alone, whether by choice or involuntarily, I just want to say hats off to you. It’s a tough mental battle to overcome, and with lockdown measures easing it’s nice to see that there’s a light at the end of the tunnel.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Grace Browne </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Write for us: <a href=\"mailto:stories@herdcommunity.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stories@herdcommunity.co.uk</a></em></h2>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/gracebrowne/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/622838b9b746d1af45a38bffc7494910?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Grace Browne\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/gracebrowne/\">Grace Browne</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

The devastation to the land, the people and the society lasted generations afterwards. This is a brief article on the British involvement in this crisis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By 1942, the Japanese had occupied the British colony of Burma and the invasion of India seemed imminent. Bengal bordered India and within it was the vital industrial hub of Calcutta, which needed protecting at all costs. The British, who ruled India at this time, decided that the best way to do this would be to implement a ‘denial policy’ – a less incendiary way of describing a ‘scorched earth’ policy – in order to deny the Japanese of any resources upon invasion. 66,000 boats were confiscated or destroyed, and thousands of tons of grain and rice were confiscated by unsupervised government agents who in some instances were reported to have thrown it into the water or set it on fire.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bengal is a region that thrives on the many tributaries and rivers that dissect the land – to take away their boats was to take away their livelihoods, accessibility to the market and destroy the rural economy. Gandhi proclaimed, “to deprive the people in East Bengal of their boats is like cutting off a vital limb.” Not only had their limited sustenance been confiscated, but so had their ability to earn. Grain and rice were redistributed to the essential wartime workers and soldiers in Calcutta, but the non-essential rural Bengalis were abandoned to starve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typical counterarguments of elitist British historians who like to portray the British Empire as a benign institution and Winston Churchill as a beacon of valiance and heroism have argued that the cyclone of 1942, the poor harvest and the cut-off of rice imports from Burma were the sole reasons for the famine. Although these contributed to the problem, the British policy of denial not only left the rural population without food or jobs, but it also upset the traditional market causing widespread hoarding and prices to skyrocket. The problem was not the unavailability of food but the inaccessibility to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout 1943, a dire famine was devastating the province of Bengal. Thousands of starving and destitute people made their way to Calcutta from the rural provinces in search of the smallest scraps of food. People fought over the starchy wastewater that rice was cooked in. Women were forced to sell their children and young girls were forced to sell themselves. A wartime survey found that sixty-two out of a hundred young girls gave starvation as their motivation to join a brothel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the countryside, whole villages had become extinct. Reporters stated that in some rural areas there was no sign of human habitation anywhere. A telling sign of the area’s abandonment and the government’s indifference to their suffering was the skeletons that littered the landscape. The Viceroy Wavell stated the Bengal Famine was “one of the greatest disasters that has befallen any people under British rule and damage to our reputation both among Indians and foreigners in India is incalculable.” Their concern was not for the millions of starving Indians, but for the reputation of the Empire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I alluded to earlier, the problem was not the lack of food but the poor’s inaccessibility to it. An American reporter for <em>Life </em>magazine reported in November 1943 that rich Indians and Europeans were eating five course meals.&nbsp; At the same time, it was reported that there were around 100,000 starving and destitute people in Calcutta. The rural Bengali was left without food, a livelihood and transport because they were not essential to the war effort, but instead an unnecessary form of collateral to Britain’s wider war effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The British response to the famine that became progressively worse throughout 1943 was not to provide immediate relief to the desperate but instead to censor and cover-up the extent of the problem. Draconian wartime censorship laws made it illegal to publicise famine and even banned public meetings to discuss aid and relief for the victims. In February 1943, the Viceroy wrote that they regarded “the situation more seriously than might be supposed from their communications to the general public.” They were left to suffer in silence in order for the British to maintain their glowing wartime image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the British government in India continuously wrote to Parliament requesting emergency relief, Winston Churchill would respond with indignance. He maintained that it was their fault for ‘breeding like rabbits’. He insisted that the excess stocks of grain that were held throughout the Empire were to be used elsewhere. Boats full of grain from Australia bypassed the millions of starving Indians and landed in southeastern Europe ready for its liberation. Starving Indians were denied grain because Churchill felt it would be more useful to be stored in Europe in case there was a lack of food in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why was there such indifference to the deaths of millions in India? Firstly, the racial paradigms of the Empire placed greater importance on the lives of the white man – Churchill said himself that Indians are “a beastly people with a beastly religion.” Secondly, Gandhi launched the Quit India Movement in 1942 in an effort to gain independence from the British Empire. Churchill’s utter contempt for the Indian people was compounded by their sheer ‘audacity’ to want independence from the ‘Great British Empire’. The lack of relief was not merely gross negligence, but a punishment for desiring self-rule.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;It was not until late August 1943 that the famine was publicised. This was due to newspaper publications and communist artists and photographers who saw that the plight of starving Bengalis and other unfortunate Indians were not anyone&#8217;s priority, or even concern. One of these artists was Chittaprosad Bhattacharya who created a work of sketches (pictured) and stories of his trips around the rural districts called <em>Hungry Bengal.</em> The British Government destroyed 5000 copies, with only one surviving. Despite the British commitment to denying the Bengalis any recognition of their suffering, these publications received worldwide attention and spurred global relief efforts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, by this time millions had already perished, Bengali people had their humanity, dignity and health stripped from them by a devastating man-made famine. The scars of famine would impact the area for generations to come and the already tortured society would suffer the further devastating impacts of millions of more deaths during the partition of the subcontinent in 1947.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only is it important to recognise this history in order to remember those that perished as a result of wider colonial manipulations, but also because British history is often glamourised and cherry picked. Winston Churchill is a glaring example of this. Yes, he was integral to British morale and decision making during the War, but throughout his political career he was a key proponent in entrenching colonial oppression and white supremacy throughout the British Empire.

They figure coming down too hard on one side gets in the way of the truth, obscuring an objective picture of reality. However, it’s worth questioning whose interests this ‘objective’ picture of reality overwhelmingly protects. It’s also worth understanding the latent potential for advocacy in the written word. According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WesleyLowery\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Wesley Lowery</em></a> (formerly of the Washington Post), “any good journalist is an activist for truth, in favour of transparency, on the behalf of accountability”. Telling stories, and deciding which stories should be told, has always been tied to these questions. Journalists can play a big role in amplifying the voices of the voiceless. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly, there are certain aspects of storytelling that really lend themselves to activism. At the beginning of COVID-19 lockdown, I co-founded <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.ourstosave.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Ours to Save</em></a><strong>,</strong> a new publication exclusively focused on the climate crisis. Ours to Save isn’t like the more traditional big news companies you rely on for your headlines, though we also hold truth and transparency to be paramount. We definitely don’t think every publication should be like us, but we do think there’s a place for journalists who want to write about problems <em>and</em> do something about them. We find inspiration in smaller, community-led publications like <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://gal-dem.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>gal-dem</em></a> and <em><a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.itsfreezinginla.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">It’s Freezing in LA!</a> </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For us, there are certain truths that are not really up for debate. The reality and urgency of the climate crisis is one of them. <a href=\"https://www.coveringclimatenow.org/about\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Covering Climate Now</em></a>, a worldwide journalism initiative committed to more and better coverage of ‘the defining story of our time’, puts it very well: </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>‘</em></strong><em>There are not two sides to a fact. For too long, especially in the US, the media juxtaposed climate science—a matter of overwhelming global consensus—with climate skepticism and denialism—seldom more than thinly-veiled protections of the fossil fuel industry. The resulting implication that these positions are equal, or that the jury is somehow still out, is in large part responsible for the public disengagement and political paralysis that have met the climate crisis so far.’&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ours to Save is a space for anyone who thinks climate change is real, and wants to do something about it. Beyond this, we’re into all manner of perspectives &#8211; whether you’re a Green New Deal advocate or a fan of ‘capitalism with constraints’, whether you’re into protesting and lobbying or you’d prefer to stay at the sidelines. We want to inform &#8211; this is science after all! &#8211; and also encourage action. Our interactive climate change map is crowdsourced, highlighting the innovative and grassroots solutions to climate change cropping up all over the world &#8211; as well as bringing local injustices to global attention. We don’t shy away from bigger questions either &#8211; how must the social contract be rewritten to deal with the intergenerational injustices caused by the climate crisis? And what role will liberal democracies and authoritarian states play, as the landscape of international security changes?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also integrate campaigns within our editorial output.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong><em>Our first campaign </em></strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>We launched our <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.timeout.com/london/news/this-campaign-wants-you-to-bring-your-own-glass-for-takeaway-pints-061620\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>first ever campaign</em></a>, #PlasticFreePints, at the beginning of June when pubs started opening up for takeaway. We wanted to encourage people to bring their own container to the pub, so as to minimise single-use plastic as much as possible, and to upload a picture to Instagram to help spread the word. Our campaign collaborators, <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.ecodisco.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>ECODISCO</em></a>, put on London’s first plastic-free party last year and now work to pioneer sustainable nightlife. They headed up the businesses side &#8211; providing pubs with recycled, reusable pint glasses so they could implement a deposit system. Pubs have opened their doors again, but many are still doing takeaway and plastic waste remains a problem in light of relaxed licensing laws.

In general, the plans demonstrate a cavalier attitude regarding the future of the global climate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>UKOG says the project will have ‘little to no environmental impact’ and will benefit the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-52682041\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>local economy</em></a>, but this is disputed by Bea Stark, a lifelong resident of the Isle of Wight who is campaigning with IoW Protection to stop the plans from going ahead. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This proposal, if accepted, will change the island irreversibly, damage tourism, devalue house prices”, Bea says. “But most importantly this is an ethical issue.

We are, rather aggressively, reminded that all bodies are great and should be celebrated. The role of social media alongside the adoption of the body positivity movement by corporations has seen an enormous campaign to tell us that we should all love ourselves. Whilst this seems like a healthy and encouraging message, does it really work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The body positivity movement actually stemmed from the ‘fat acceptance’ movement of the 1960s, which sought to dismantle prejudice and discrimination against marginalised bodies, especially those which are fat, black, queer or disabled. The key difference to note here is that the fat acceptance movement sought to challenge the way society viewed <em>other people’s</em> bodies, but the body positivity movement asks us to change the way we view <em>our own. </em>We’re having to readjust our feelings and perspective in order to celebrate our bodies and see just how brilliant they are.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may seem fantastic, however it is actually really problematic. Perhaps without meaning to, the body positivity movement feeds into the very narrative that it should oppose – the fact that we should view our body in a certain way because others have told us to. Ultimately, it is removing our ability to exercise control over how we perceive ourselves, and instead suggesting that our mindset should be based upon the latest media trends. This is not anything new. Let’s begin at the start of the decade when beauty standards celebrated being stick thin, notoriously summarised by Kate Moss’ comment that ‘nothing tastes as good as skinny feels’. Outrage at this saw the rise of the idealised curvy body – think Beyoncé and Jennifer Lopez. Then came along the fitness craze; intense workout and meal plans created by the likes of Instagrammers such as Kayla Itsines and celebrities who celebrated their ‘transformations’, promising that by buying into whatever they were selling, you could also transform into a better version of you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, body positivity is just the latest trend in regard to beauty standards – love your body because we told you to. Just like we told you to be thin, curvy, athletic, sexualised and youthful. Admittedly, this new standard of loving yourself can’t be all bad, and if it works for you, then great. But what if it doesn’t?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Body positivity is taking an already delicate subject and adding the extra pressure that you have to be outwardly confident in your body even if you don’t live up to the current idealised beauty standards. It is no longer enough to look a certain way, you now have to<em> feel </em>a certain way towards how you look, and if you don’t, then you’ve failed at this as well. Autumn Whitefield-Madrano, author of <em>Face Value: The Hidden Ways Beauty Shapes Women’s Lives, </em>sums this up really well: ‘My problem with body love, beside the fact that it’s a high standard, it’s asking women to regulate their emotions, not just their bodies… I don’t see the pressure on women really easing up, and then you’re supposed to have this bulletproof self-esteem on top of that’.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is perfectly fine and completely <em><u>normal</u> </em>to not love the way you look. Asking us to love ourselves 24/7 is unrealistic and it creates a cop out narrative that seems equal to telling a person with depression to ‘cheer up’ or asking someone with anxiety to ‘calm down’. Whilst I’m sure we’d all like to live in some utopian version of our lives where everything is perfect and full of bliss, this is not the reality – so why should we project such an unattainable ideal onto our perceptions of ourselves?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of body positivity, let’s advocate body NEUTRALITY. Although not a new approach, body neutrality has gained a lot of traction recently from those who reject the pressures associated with body positivity. The idea is simple: like body positivity, let’s steer the conversation away from hating the way we look but without replacing it with the need to love the way we look either. In short, it is about ‘working towards a place where we respect our bodies, but don’t give too much energy to positive or negative thoughts about it’ &#8211; Kat Nicholls.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, whilst it won’t happen overnight, let’s allow ourselves the freedom to live our lives in a way that does not place such a strong emphasis on our bodies. Yes, we can like some aspects of our bodies, and yes, we can also dislike others. But this is not the be all and end all, it is just one part of life that we should acknowledge, accept and ultimately, move on from.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of focusing all this time and energy into what we look like, let’s acknowledge that your body is not there for aesthetic reasons. Your body works in such a way that allows you to live, to walk, to run, to create, and to literally bring more humans into this world. Respect your body for that, then utilise it and allow yourself to do exactly what your body is designed to do – to let you live your life. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Ella Young </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Write for us: <a href=\"mailto:stories@herdcommunity.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stories@herdcommunity.co.uk</a></em></h2>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/ellayoung/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c5988681f08ef890d7ca905345b61c5f?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Ella Young\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/ellayoung/\">Ella Young</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

The point of this article is not in any way to diminish the hurt that Hopkins has caused or to justify any of the horrific things she has said, and it’s certainly understandable that so many people have been quick to celebrate her cancelling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, I am arguing that Katie Hopkins should not have been banned from Twitter, and furthermore that Twitter’s recent trend towards censorship will have more damaging democratic consequences than if they simply allowed their platform to be virtually unchecked.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a quote, famously misattributed to Voltaire (but actually stated by Evelyn Beatrice Hall) that: “<em>I disapprove of what you say, but I defend to the death your right to say it</em>”. Whilst there is clearly a bit more nuance which could be applied to freedom of speech issues, I’d suggest it shouldn’t go much further than the above statement. Freedom of speech means exactly that, no matter how repulsive your views might be. This, of course, does not necessarily mean that anyone would be allowed to post these views on Twitter which, after all, is a private company that has the power to set and enforce rules on what isn’t allowed on their platform.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my personal opinion however, by setting higher standards than the US First Amendment (the UK has far stricter regulations on free speech which should be fought against)- where <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions#False_statements_of_fact\">essentially everything</a> bar the most extreme and clear incitements of violence is allowed- Twitter is losing that which made it such an innovative and exciting project from the off. Twitter was originally a massive experiment in radical democracy, of free speech applying and being utilised by hundreds of millions of people on a largely equal footing. Ordinary people, with virtually no following can call out to professional athletes, high-ranking politicians and other world-famous celebrities. They can insult, make ridiculous statements, and post jokes which either none or many would find amusing. And that’s really what makes Twitter so great. The fact that people can connect with people all over the world at the click of a button, and say whatever you want.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a political perspective it can force legislators to explain their decision making, which can often lead to better decisions being made. Take the recent example of Marcus Rashford, who launched a Twitter campaign to force Boris Johnson to make a U-Turn on the issue of providing free school meals to underprivileged children during the pandemic. Politicians, and even corporations, can be in fear of an angry ‘Twitter mob’.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also means that so much of what goes on in our world, from the ordinary to the sublime, to the ridiculous, gets seen by millions around the globe. This includes brutal and unnecessary war crimes, and acts of horrific police violence. These can get shared without fear of having this material censored by those who are shamed by it. Thus, in many ways, progress can be achieved and minds can be changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/eo_qEihi4SNi69ZPFZGaK7NS3LpXd68WAiXprWah47IL5yR6FI5liVYVjd53Fz48OYZNw0QVZB0CFrpZnTbShcRGx_fT_SQFqhn7ufjKiHpyKTqVXNytHxwroRvliOEO1ZZnWkdc\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Here though, I go back to the Evelyn Hall statement and contend that this freedom applied to posting on Twitter has to include things which don’t conform to a broadly liberal view of society. And further still, to include statements which are actively antithetical to that, which seek to divide people based on characteristics we can’t control.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a reason why Noam Chomsky, one of the most famous and respected left-wing academics has stated that the “vicious ugly speech” of the KKK should be allowed under the First Amendment, stating: “I don’t feel the right way to deal with disgusting, hateful speech is by banning it”. The American Civil Liberties Union, often decried by conservatives as being a left-wing organisation, actually <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-em-defends-kkks-right-free-speech\">defended the KKK</a> in a 2012 court case. They argued that “even when the viewpoints are not popular”, they must “protect the free speech rights of all” or risk “having the government arbitrarily decide what is&#8230;acceptable speech”. Neither Chomsky or the ACLU can be said to have been tacitly supporting the KKK in defending their free speech rights. The ACLU famously stood with the NAACP during the Civil Rights Movement in America, whilst Chomsky has been critiquing and fighting against racism his whole academic career. Nevertheless, both understood that by adding caveats to rights of expression, the whole notion of free speech is diminished. It is perfectly fine to fundamentally disagree with someone’s opinion, yet believe they have the right to express it on a public platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to understand what happens when ‘cancel culture’ removes a supposedly unacceptable opinion from the public sphere. The removal of figures such as Tommy Robinson and Katie Hopkins from Twitter has allowed both of them to present themselves as martyrs for their particular far-right cause. They are able to claim that they are the modern day <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/katie-hopkins-proclaims-herself-the-jesus-of-the-outspoken-its-a-very-dangerous-message-78544\">embodiment of Jesus</a>, and, as ridiculous as that sounds to us, her supporters will lap it up. ‘<em>The establishment has always been against us, we were right</em>’, they will cry, and this will only embolden them further. I understand the argument many will respond with, that by removing them from Twitter where there are hundreds of millions of people, the potential chance of someone being radicalised to the far-right is decreased. However, in my opinion, those who were on the edge of a conversion to the far right could now be utterly convinced that Hopkins and others have had it correct all along: <em>the woke left, liberal establishment and their cancelling culture once again</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QoCPUHSSf3x9FSFA4h5aFBB2zKb3KapZqdmBMyqFupmH-Lh4rVj-fNoMUkHaFPedvQj4pEKNAA7qqojth2Z-fMlKtsIaHpXiaO3mfUC1sSaSXzwi_A-svgtc-MKa4JFqefAyCAzu\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>And where do these people go when the key figures are banned from Twitter, and the whole site is deemed to be a liberal cesspit? Well by the looks of things, they’re heading to <a href=\"https://www.patheos.com/blogs/tippling/2020/06/29/twexit-to-parler-the-right-wing-are-fleeing-twitter/\">Parler</a>&#8211; an absolute hellhole of far-right, ultra-conservative white nationalism and homophobia. Now filled with names such as Donald Trump Jr., Milo Yiannopolous and Mohammad Bin Salman (<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/parler-app-mps-right-wing-twitter-katie-hopkins-a9579241.html\">and lots of Tory MP’s</a>), the conservatives’ answer to Twitter has already been found to have touted some of the worst anti-semitic, Islamophobic and anti-Black conspiracy theories- crucially- without any chance for liberal-minded people to respond. If ordinary people, those who have been convinced that Twitter is too liberal by the alt-right (with the help of Twitter’s new-found banning powers), it will be incredibly difficult for them to get out of this mindset. Instead, if these things were being said out in the open, on a platform where claiming that George Soros is behind every man-made disaster to befall the earth is likely to generate lots of condemnatory responses, many more people will come to see the statement for the madness that it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was John Stuart Mill who first wrote of the idea of a ‘free marketplace of ideas’ which would lead to falsehoods being separated from facts- that the truth of an argument would eventually come out if everyone had the chance to express their opinions. Obviously, Mill never could’ve imagined the world of social media, though I think he would’ve been a fan. My personal hope from Twitter (and social media in general) is that over time- certainly not immediately- that the platforms ability to highlight the worlds’ ills, and ways to fix them. Which leads me on to another major reason why Twitter’s trend to censorship worries me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst most on the left cheered the bans of Alex Jones, Tommy Robinson and Katie Hopkins- to do so is legitimising the use of censorship power by Silicon Valley billionaires. And there is certainly no guarantee this power will consistently be used in ways that are fair, or grounded in reality. I certainly don’t trust Jack Dorsey and others to be the arbiters of truth, and to only use their powers of censorship on racists and homophobes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, Twitter and other social media sites have deemed certain ideas too radical to be acceptable on their public platforms, but who&#8217;s to say this won’t be used against people on the left who challenge the mainstream status-quo. There is already evidence to back this up: Twitter has already banned accounts of members of the <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/twitter-political-account-ban-us-mid-term-elections\">Occupy movement,</a> with no explanation, as well as parody accounts mocking Joe Biden and American cable news channels, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/21/facebook-and-twitter-remove-hundreds-of-accounts-linked-to-iranian-and-russian-political-meddling/?guccounter=1\">but also accounts</a> which were deemed to be anti-Saudi. As Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsaud of Saudi Arabia now owns more of Twitter than <a href=\"https://qz.com/519388/this-saudi-prince-now-owns-more-of-twitter-than-jack-dorsey-does/\">Jack Dorsey himself</a>, the new trend to censorship is likely to continue to target people critical of the Saudi regime. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/aXBpg30orNueJkw2BPILI349PA5VNtsmeV_51qAlIt2W1TyeupAJNgWOYf6q7Ub2_swXpTbqjRZplzZLrDAEtOt1_OLLMrQ0ehqTq4v984YdP5qz50qa_pnYnia55STiIvbklSFT\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the dangerous precedent that has been set by the banning of far-right figures, and the calls to ban others such as Donald Trump, and Nigel Farage. Twitter and others now feel they have a responsibility to l<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/20/21146039/twitter-misleading-tweets-label-misinformation-social-media-2020-bernie-sanders\">abel misinformation</a>, and ultimately act as ministries of truth, determining what we should and should not deem acceptable. The trend is towards only allowing a very narrow, mainstream, pro-establishment discourse on social media sites which should be concerning to all. People should be allowed to view opinions from all across the political spectrum, and to make their own minds up on issues based on their own research. The denial of free speech rights to those who are unacceptably radical within the circles of tech entrepreneurs and Saudi Princes, and I don’t think we should be celebrating it regardless of how much better Twitter might seem without Katie Hopkins.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/author/glynsheldon/\">By Glyn Sheldon</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Write for us: <a href=\"mailto:stories@herdcommunity.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stories@herdcommunity.co.uk</a></em></h2>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/glynsheldon/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b6f4eedcc4559f94dd10458b659bb94a?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Glyn Sheldon\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/glynsheldon/\">Glyn Sheldon</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

I’m sure a lot of you were unaware that the UK even had one, but to the students and residents of Leeds, it is common knowledge. After decades of the area being notorious for illegal street prostitution and trafficking, the Leeds City council introduced the ‘Managed Approach’ scheme in 2014 after a young Polish sex worker was murdered in the area, with the aim to make it a much safer place for the women to be and work without fear of arrest, and the ability to call the police if they are in trouble. This 13 part series from BBC 3 follows and documents the lives of various women working in the area over the space of a year or two, giving us valuable insight into the daily struggles and the intense battle against addiction. It is a hard watch at points, and a harsh reality into a dark underground industry, which inevitably ruins lives. Throughout, it is difficult not to become emotionally attached to the women as the series does a great job of not just focusing on the sex work and drug addiction, but the kind and bubbly personalities of the girls desperately trying to escape that life. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Life Inside Britain&#039;s Legal Red Light District | Sex, Drugs &amp; Murder - Episode 1\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z8Oma_yvMh8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Conman: The life and crimes of Mark Acklom</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is human nature to be completely and totally fascinated with people like Mark Acklom, the UK’s most notorious Conman who for years stole millions of pounds, pretending to be someone he’s not. Starting in his teens, he convinced his school teacher to lend him £15,000 to trade in the stock market (which was ultimately never seen again), stole his fathers gold AMEX and flew him and his mates around Europe in private jets and even convinced a building society to grant him a mortgage of £500,000 for a mansion in south London, Mark Acklom epitomised the term ‘gift of the gab’. However, these crimes barely scratch the surface on what would be an entire life of crime, conning and fraud. From faking an entire marriage with no remorse to having endless different identities, this documentary short leaves you wondering: how could someone do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Conman: The life and crimes of Mark Acklom\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BBwKmH3QLt0?start=1898&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>How mental illness derailed the career of a promising young skateboarder</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although this centuries generation is largely much more in tune with mental health and its affects, there still undeniably remains a huge stigma around male mental health with worryingly high suicide rates still prevalent. This documentary short delves right into that stigma, detailing the successful but short career of skateboarder Paul Alexander, who made a name for himself in the industry for his unique style and ability to land tricks others could not. He seemed destined for the very top, but a gradual decline in his mental health (largely in my opinion caused by smoking copious amounts of weed on a daily basis) resulted in the very opposite. Talking, expressing, having mates to confide in and seeking professional help are all clearly lacking whilst desperately trying to stay within the skateboard narrative of ‘cool’, even if the cost is everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>P.s to my fellow lads, a simple ‘how are you doing mate?’ can go a long way.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"How Mental Illness Derailed the Career of a Promising Young Skateboarder\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/d09soDoUvaw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Carl Cox – Space is the place</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This video is usually on resident advisor’s channel but for some reason it has been taken down, however someone has replaced it and it’s linked below. Resident advisor also has loads of great content on the techno and house scenes too so explore the channel for yourself. This documentary short follows one of the greatest DJ’s of all time Carl Cox as he enters his final season of his 27-year residency at the legendary Space club in Ibiza. However, rather than solely focusing on the bright lights, hedonism and glamour that comes with being a superstar DJ, the film takes us back to Carl’s roots, exploring where he grew up in the sleepy suburbs of London and discussing the sacrifices he has made throughout the years by leading a unique life constantly on the move. Alongside this we are given an insight into his extraordinary performing talent, captivating the desperate crowds lining up for hours just to catch a glimpse of the master at work – one last time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Carl Cox - Space is the place\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5m3sKyKfx74?start=1652&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>The detail geek</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lets finish with a silly one.

I know what your thinking, but please watch the video linked and TELL me that isn’t satisfying. I wanted to click off, but I couldn’t, I needed to know how the car was going to look after the full clean, I was in too deep. 2 hours later and I’m still watching this lad cleaning a rusty old van that looks like a bombs gone off in it, but not going to lie – after this master cleaner is done with it – it looks like a new car. So to conclude, this guy really knows how to clean a car. So don’t be ashamed and indeed, watch him clean some cars.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Deep Cleaning the MUDDIEST Truck Ever! | Insane Disaster Detail and Epic Transformation!\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qc6fZ_J1vbc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Luke Davies </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Write for us: <a href=\"mailto:stories@herdcommunity.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stories@herdcommunity.co.uk</a></em></h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/lukedavies/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/37b6cc9e3fd5615b51ee5575397c101a?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Luke Davies\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/lukedavies/\">Luke Davies</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

        "content": "\n<p>Ever been punched in the face for your sexuality? I have. At the time, it wasn’t very fun but now it makes a good story. Especially the part about still not being able to hear very well out of my left ear after a fist landed directly on it. At that point of the story telling, someone would normally ask a question and, as witty as this bisexual man is, I’d pretend not to hear. Everyone would laugh and we’d go back to drinking or playing Fifa. I still tilt my head to the right slightly to make sure I hear what people are saying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have never really been scared of my sexuality when out in public or at a club or on the bus, tube, in a shop, pub or a restaurant. But then, I’ve never really thought about whether or not I’m afraid of showing my sexuality. When I start to think about it more and more, it is more of a realisation that I’m used to a certain norm of revealing a small part of my personality at certain times and hiding a big chunk of it at others. For the majority of my life, I truly believed that other people’s homophobia or biphobia was my problem; I shouldn’t go somewhere because someone who I knew was homophobic would be there; I shouldn’t wear pearls or a beret to a village pub because I’d get strange looks. In fact, I once ordered prawn cocktail crisps in a pub and the bartender said that they were for gays. I guess he was right. A fucking bigot but bang on. Whilst living in Russia, me and my friends asked another customer in a shop which vodka was the best and he pointed to one on the shelf and said, “not this one. This one’s for gays.” Of course, I looked down in my basket and it was the one I had picked up. I cannot remember what astonished me more, his casual homophobia or his accuracy. But isn’t it more astonishing to know that Britain shares the same levels of casual homophobia as Russia? And there we were all thinking that Russia was this backwards country where people are beaten and killed for their sexuality and in England you can vogue down the street and everyone around will join in like an outtake from Hairspray. Though, I was never really scared of my sexuality when living in Russia because, in some strange, messed up way, there is some comfort in the casual homophobia, knowing that facing it with silence or walking away leaves the more dangerous homophobia bubbling away under the surface. The kind of homophobia you read in the news, like the murder of LGBTQ+ activist, Yelena Grigoryeva, or the murder of Vladislav Tornovoi in Volgograd after he came out to his “friends”, the anti-gay purges in Chechnya or the hundreds of other murders and beatings you will never read about. You may ask, “but that’s Russia, right?” And I’d pretend not to hear. Simply, no. Of course, there may be more frequent, horrific attacks in Russia and former Soviet satellite states, but you don’t start hopping because your other leg doesn’t work. By that I mean you should not disregard an issue because it is bound to another country because if you support the LGBTQ+ Community it is not enough to just support it once a year when you go to a Pride parade in Brighton or London or Manchester.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>England has dangerous (note: all kinds of homophobia is dangerous) levels of homophobia bubbling under the surface too, just like Russia. My first glimpses of it were getting hit for my sexuality and also having to change my route to college as I was followed around my hometown by a boy who asked, “are you gay? Are you bi? If you are, I’m gonna punch you in your fucking face.” Many people will still think that often people say these things and have anti-LGBTQ+ opinions because they question their own sexuality. I want to briefly say that I think this is absolute bollocks. Sure, sometimes a guy might say he doesn’t like gay men because he wants to cover up for the fact that he himself questions his own sexuality, but it is important to understand that most people have anti-LGBTQ+ views because they are (often) uneducated and full of hate. A racist white man isn’t racist because he thinks he’s secretly not white – he’s racist because he’s racist; uneducated, absorbed the opinions of his racist parents, reads the newspapers and blog posts of other racists, thinks racist jokes are funny etc. etc. etc. I hear the guy that followed me around my hometown is in prison now, which, if what people say about homophobic people is true, good for him – I hear it’s a great place to pick up guys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Britain is full of homophobic hatred. And it is for this reason that Pride is – and should still be – a protest. According to the Evening Standard, there has been a 22% rise in homophobic attacks year-on-year with almost 55 <em>recorded</em> attacks each week. We all saw the London bus attack where four teenagers aged between 15 and 17 attacked a gay couple, leaving them with facial injuries. Do you really think those <em>kids</em> did that because they’re all questioning their own sexuality? Want to know what I did when I was questioning my sexuality? I spent a lot of time googling “How not to be gay”, bought a pair of baggy jeans and started listening to more hip hop. I did not start attacking gay couples to throw people off the scent. Recently, one of the biggest names in literature, J.K. Rowling, spoke out against transgender women and the use of single-sex spaces. Firstly, I’m confused as to why anyone might get their opinions from someone who *checks notes* wrote books about a fucking wizard, but the most dangerous part of Rowling’s comments was that she used her platform and notoriety as one of the highest selling authors to churn misinformed and offensive opinions about the lives of people which are debated as if they are simply a point of discussion for abuse or what it means to be a woman/man. There is a wealth of brilliant articles which break down and discuss J.K Rowling’s statements, which I suggest you read, if you have not done so already. Though, at this point, I would like to remind you what the ‘T’ stands for in LGBTQ+. Put simply, you cannot support the LGBTQ+ Community without supporting the lives of Transgender people. Much like with the Black Lives Matter movement, you do not get to pick and choose which lives you support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why Pride is still a protest. Such a statement should not be a radical assertion, but a reminder. A reminder that Pride began as a riot against police brutality and fought for by queer heroes such as Marsha P. Johnson, Stormé DeLarverie, Sylvia Rivera and Tammy Novak. A reminder that, as queer folk or allies, when we can attend Pride events again, we do so not for the music or the hiked-up drinks prices or the glitter or the outfits or the fun day-out, but to remind ourselves that the freedoms many LGBTQ+ people have nowadays were fought for by a community that are still hurting across the world. Whilst the casual homophobia and the heinous anti-LGBTQ+ hatred bubbles away under the surface of societies worldwide, we must not think of Pride only as a festival. Whilst there is still a fight to be fought in the name of queer rights, Pride will always be a protest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Ry Jackson</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/ryjackson/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/69d7897173528a324c2a34fed4790a98?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Ry Jackson\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/ryjackson/\">Ry Jackson</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

After a painful 10 weeks in which the country toiled with a deadly pandemic, the return of the beautiful game was the medicine we needed to lift some dampened spirits. Whilst the lack of fans makes for a peculiar and unsettling viewing (despite the commendable efforts by EA sports to provide fake crowd noise), most fans can take comfort in the fact that normal services will soon enough be resumed. We’ll enjoy a pre-match beer again, pubs will be packed to the rafters on a Saturday rumbling with dumbfounded optimism, we’ll travel countrywide and witness moments of pure last-minute-winning elation again&#8230; Or will we?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brief disappearance of football from our lives meant there was a moment to savour in the middle of lockdown; a moment when the existence of a toxic virus tearing its way through the game had been all but forgotten. This virus has the frightening potential to take away some of life’s most spectacular, adrenaline-fuelled moments and turn our beautiful game into a robotic simulation with zero space for humanity. To add insult to injury, it is cursed with an evil ambition to destroy the potential for a future of iconic <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/a-precious-moment-to-reflect-on-an-iconic-sporting-decade/\">sporting moments</a>. They call it ‘VAR’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not going to discuss the metaphorical ‘VAR (Video Assistant Referee)’ virus without acknowledging the tragic impact that Covid-19 has inflicted on our football community. All 20 premier league clubs will have lost fans during this unforgiving pandemic; there will be empty seats when we return to our respective grounds which will need to be reallocated. Players and managers have been deeply affected too, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/27/aston-villa-manager-dean-smiths-father-ron-dies-after-contracting-covid-19\">Dean Smith</a>, Aston Villa’s manager, tragically lost his father in May after contracting the virus in a care home. Dean is now tasked with keeping his father’s boyhood club in the premier league, and must do so facing the empty stands where his father would once sit to cheer on his beloved claret and blue. Dean is certainly not alone and my heart goes out to all those who now live with the reality of attending future football matches without their usual companions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The truth is, as devastating as it may be, coronavirus will one day be behind us and life will move on. Worryingly, I’m unsure the same can be said for ‘VAR’. For those who may need a little context, the Video Assistant Referee was first written into football law in <a href=\"https://img.fifa.com/image/upload/khhloe2xoigyna8juxw3.pdf\">2018</a>, making its way to the Premier League for the 19/20 campaign. The primary reason for its introduction on our shores was the perception that English football was riddled with ‘shocking’ decisions that were costing teams points, and ultimately, their position in the league. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most vocal supporters of VAR were <a href=\"https://www.90min.com/posts/4732871-west-brom-s-tony-pulis-champions-video-technology-manager-review-system-for-premier-league\">undoubtedly managers</a>, who used it’s lack of application as the perfect excuse for why their team may have lost. As the 2010’s progressed, the age-old managerial press conference excuse of blaming the ‘ref’ was slowly displaced by a cry for technology to solve all of football’s problems. Rather than accepting our game was beautiful in all its controversies, the football authorities caved to the very managers that are unlikely to be present in the game in 10 years time. As always, fans will be left to pick up the pieces.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of July 1st, studies suggest as many as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42781236\">93%</a> of refereeing decisions were correct during the pre-VAR era, meaning the standard of human officiating in the English game was pretty remarkable &#8211; but that wasn’t enough. For context, the same study suggested that 98.9% of refereeing decisions were deemed to be correct following a 2 year worldwide trial using VAR.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The irony of the study and the crux of many anti-VAR arguments is that football decisions are subjective and remain up for debate even with the application of high resolution, ultra slow-motion video replays. Whilst this is undeniably true, this argument has many faltering components and should not form the basis of any anti-VAR movement. If the technology is eradicating clear wrong decisions and deliberating (usually correctly) on a number of close calls, it is serving its purpose as an aggregator of decision making.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without question, VAR improves the number of correct refereeing decisions in a football game. However, such an argument misses the point entirely regarding VAR. The truly poisonous and game-threatening failures of the technology lie in two definitive areas:</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>1</strong>. <strong>The technology inherently favours cancelling goals</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, the technology in its current form is programmed to unfavourably disallow goals. Since the beginning of this season, <a href=\"https://www.espn.co.uk/football/english-premier-league/story/3929823/how-var-decisions-have-affected-every-premier-league-club\">25 VAR</a> decisions have led to a resulting goal, whereas 48 have been disallowed. There have been 30 goals chalked out because of offside, yet only 8 awarded after an incorrect offside call. 10 goals have been ruled out due to ‘handball’ &#8211; a rule which roughly 0 football fans totally understand &#8211; whilst 2 goals have been awarded after a wrong handball decision. The only increase in goal potential has derived by the rise in the number of penalties and indirectly through a growing number of red cards.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These figures spell it out quite simply: VAR in its current format provides us with a transformed game. A game which has considerably fewer goals from open play, more goals disallowed, more red cards (and subsequent bans) &amp; more penalties. Given most of the groundbreaking rule changes in football in the last century have been enforced to enhance the entertainment of the sport, VAR feels like a drastically backward step. But such patterns are to be expected if VAR continues. Given the break in play following a goal, each goal scored is currently analysed for offside or defensive misdemeanors in the build-up. Clearly, a significant number of fouls, handballs and marginal offsides will have been missed in the lead up to every goal due to human error &#8211; this accounts for the 48 disallowed goals this season. Furthermore, once the technology is in place, it’s difficult to argue that it should only intervene with ‘clear and obvious’ errors, as the boundary between ‘obvious’ and ‘ambiguous’ will then provide the sticking point for every single VAR argument in the game.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The evidence presented clearly points out that the system is skewed so that VAR will always cancel out more goals than it awards. The reason is simple, the only time that VAR can positively award a goal is in response to a previously disallowed goal by the officials. Anyone who watches football will understand that there are far more goals scored in a football season then there are disallowed. In turn, VAR inherently favours disallowing goals &#8211; it is a negative tool.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>2. The technology threatens the inexplicable joy of every goal scored</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Most importantly, VAR constrains the uninterrupted joy that a goal <em>should</em> create in football. I firmly believe this is the overriding reason as to why football is the greatest sport on the planet. I speak for many when I say that several of my life&#8217;s most jubilant moments have derived from a football hitting the back of the net. Let’s reminisce: Agueroooo 2012, Torres at the Camp Nou, Gerrard against Olympiakos, Sturridge against Wales&#8230; pure, unadulterated, adrenaline-fuelled, stupendous joy. Nothing matches it. These goals are the reason fans travel up and down the country and across Europe watching their team religiously; we’re chasing the buzz, clutching to the possibility that we might see the illustrious, rare, 90th minute winner.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the presence of VAR in our game, these moments are in grave danger. Regardless of whether the goal-in-question is chalked off or not, the moment of pure elation is hindered in the knowledge that VAR may come along to spoil the party. You can, and never will, celebrate those historic goals in the same way &#8211; as you’re doing so with a seed of doubt that the ball may have perhaps brushed the upper arm of your player 30 seconds prior to the goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re happy to sacrifice those truly special moments and replace them with half-hearted celebrations, restricted in the knowledge that VAR may be there to thwart your joy, then I think we will have to agree to disagree. In truth, I also believe you’re following football for all the wrong reasons. I plead with you to ask yourself: Is inadvertently ruining the greatest moments in football, and the most memorable moments in people’s lives, really worth it for a 5.9% increase in correct officiating decisions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a personal level, I still speak regularly of the moment Stephen Ward scored the winner for Wolves against Liverpool at Anfield 10 years ago. It sticks in my mind as one of my fondest football memories, and one of the warmest memories I have of my dad, a lifelong Wolves fan with whom I shared my earliest football experiences. The moment the goal was scored was utterly euphoric and the unmatchable joy which was exchanged between myself, my dad, my brother and my uncle will stay with me for a lifetime.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should this moment be reciprocated today, the presence of VAR would sadly nullify a considerable level of the excitement and such special memories would cease to exist. The ruling authorities are to blame, an unfortunate vindication that those who make the important decisions in football do so without the interests of the genuine fans that uphold their very institutions. You only need to attend one football match this season to understand the collective frustration towards what technology is doing to the game. ‘Fuck VAR’ etc &#8211; you get the gist. However, what was first frustration has since festered into a growing sadness that football may never provide me with another uninterrupted ‘Stephen Ward’ moment whilst VAR remains present in football. The essence of the fan experience has been stripped away from us. The beautiful game is at risk of losing its real beauty. VAR out.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Oliver Kriskinans</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Please give this article a rating below!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Write for us: <a href=\"mailto:stories@herdcommunity.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stories@herdcommunity.co.uk</a></em></h2>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/oliverkriskinans/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a6d50d7b8b07b86bf001b346a1783385?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Oliver Kriskinans\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/oliverkriskinans/\">Oliver Kriskinans</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

It is pretty despairing to hear rap&#8217;s greatest voices repeatedly lamenting the deep-seated prejudice underpinning the murders of unarmed black men. Maybe there is some hope that by sharing their perspectives they are elevating the often easily erased stories, into spaces they might not otherwise reach. But to what extent is this true? As much as rap music continues to thrive in mainstream culture, soundtracking white spaces like a PureGym in Norwich, how much of this music is actually heard? Are people really listening to the messages in the lyrics of their favourite rap anthems or is half of raps audience just gym bros looking for some background noise to get a pump on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not everybody, regardless of race, age or preferred genre, chooses to go beyond surface level with the music they listen to. But some artists make this nigh on impossible. Cue Run The Jewels. This duo of intense truth tellers; El-P and Killer Mike, craftily balance brassy humour (they&#8217;re not short of crude jokes) with intelligent social commentary, drawing listeners in to assess and question the world we live in. You don&#8217;t have to investigate very far into RTJ to understand their interest in challenging the ruling classes, with Killer Mike coining the slogan ‘Kill your Masters’. Mike explains this in an interview with The Line of Best Fit in 2017: ‘If I leave any legacy besides music, that’s what I’d want it to be: to let people know that they are absolutely free, and that you have the power to bring who you perceive to be powerful to their fucking knees. Kill your masters.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Killer Mike is used to the limelight. The rapper started making his mark in activism at the beginnings of his music career in the early 2000s. More recently, in the wake of&nbsp; RTJ’s new album<em> RTJ4,</em> Killer Mike’s activism has been propelled back into the public eye. On May 29th, Mike stood up and made an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RC8jnN-zp5M\">impassioned speech</a> to Atlanta protesters on his thoughts in response to <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/black-lives-cannot-stop-mattering-lets-keep-the-conversation-going/\">George Floyd’s</a> murder. He urged the protesters to stay calm: ‘now is the time to plot, plan, strategize, organize, and mobilize.” The rapper powerfully surmised ‘We don’t want to see targets burning, we want to see the system that sets up for systemic racism burnt to the ground.” Four days later and RTJ bring forward the drop of <em>RTJ4</em> (available as a free download), providing Mike’s followers and the group&#8217;s fans with more understanding, motivation and ammunition to carry on fighting the good fight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>RTJ4 </em>is another masterpiece showing us why rap is the perfect tool for social activism. Each time you return to the album you uncover a new pearl of wisdom, experience anger and pain, but also joy &#8211; this is a soundtrack to progress. About half way into the album you’re hit with the powerful track: ‘Walking in the Snow’. Mike spits improvised rhymes (Mike doesn&#8217;t write before he records) over jarring electro, delivering the albums most unapologetic calling out of police brutality: <em>‘</em><em>And you so numb you watch the cops choke out a man like me/ And &#8217;til my voice goes from a shriek to whisper, &#8220;I can&#8217;t breathe.&#8221;&nbsp; </em>This comment on the desensitisation of violence towards&nbsp; black bodies is not tragically prophetic to George Floyd’s murder (the album was made a significant time before this event).&nbsp; This is a reference to Eric Garner, who spoke the same dying words when&nbsp; strangled by a police chokehold in New York City nearly six years ago. You can pick out a lot from just these two lines. When Mike is using the words, ‘man like me’, we understand this unspoken acceptance that being a black man in America is a death sentence. It would be wrong to say it was luck that the release of this album was so timely with the recent tragedies in the news. However, what this album does show is the power of this music to put into words the generational trauma of racism in America. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all 11 songs on RTJ4 confront these hard hitting issues in this way.&nbsp; RTJ team up with rap heavyweights Greg Nice and DJ Premier for ‘ooh la la’, sampling&nbsp; old school goodness from Greg Nice’s verse in the DJ Premier produced song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgelVkHEKdw\">“DWYCK”</a> by Gang Starr. In a <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/4qww891hIqRsMMAjbmWQiF\">Rolling Stone Music&nbsp; podcast</a> Mike speaks about how much joy DWYCK brought him and how translating this joy was the main intention for ‘ooh la la.’ The song playfully imagines a world without capitalism. Mike reinstates the kill your masters narrative, drawing parallels between himself and beloved popular culture super villain the Joker,(<em>I used to love Bruce, but livin&#8217; my vida local/ Help me understand, I&#8217;m probably more of a Joker’</em>) a character many interpret as a sort of anticapitalist&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>gangster. No track on RTJ4&nbsp; is stuck on one sound, mixing it up between east coast hip hop samples from rap&#8217;s golden years and Mike’s aggressive southern rap flow. The group&#8217;s experimental side shines through in ‘JU$T’, enlisting the kings of the alternative: funk-rap producer Pharrel Williams and the rap-rock frontman of Rage Against the Machine, Zack de la Rocha. This track is another stand out moment on the album, Pharrel providing an overtly raw chorus where even the most casual of listeners cannot ignore the commentary on racism and capitalism: ‘<em>The Thirteenth Amendment says that slavery’s abolished / Look at all these slave masters posin’ on yo&#8217; dollar’.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Run The Jewels - JU$T [ft.

RTJ rap about what drives them. What is on their minds goes into their music.&nbsp; Not every one of their songs is written to drive you towards a certain political morality, but as long as systemic racism keeps rearing its ugly head in our world, it will keep showing up in the music. But with this repetition comes hope. When speaking with <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/4qww891hIqRsMMAjbmWQiF\"><em>Rolling Stone</em></a>, Mike could not come across a better figure of optimism: ‘Times are finally prepped. In this moment right here, we have an opportunity to change legislation that&nbsp;means police will be held accountable. We have an opportunity to seize the moment, where money does not matter over the cost of human life.’ RTJ4 landed just on time, to pick up the woes of the long fight for equality and frame them with hope. RTJ will keep their listeners and fans joyfully entertained, but they will always make time for activism, time to make protest music for the masses. It&#8217;s hard to imagine any listeners could not be engaged with this, but now is a time, if ever, to remind consumers of rap and black music to read between the lines. The recent quoting of activist Amanda Seales, by Radio One presenter Clara Amfo springs to mind: ‘You cannot enjoy the rhythm and ignore the blues’. RTJ4 embodies this. You are not meant to sit and cry at every track but this will never be music to just listen to.

In that year, the birthplace of UK music festivals took place on <a href=\"https://www.skiddle.com/news/all/Music-Festivals-a-timeline-through-the-years/54074/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>the Isle of Wight</strong></a> with a small number of attendees, but by 1970 the popularity had skyrocketed and over 600,000 music-lovers came together to share their joy in listening to live music. It only took two years for the popularity of this music festival to reach these incredible numbers, which in turn caused the Conservative UK government to ban the festival due to fear that the wild partying would be harmful to the island. However, luckily for us one of Glastonbury’s founders, Andrew Kerr, was one of these previously mentioned music-lovers who attended the festival in 1970. So, we must pay thanks to that tiny Isle of Wight festival for hosting Andrew Kerr. His experience there provided him with the inspiration to approach Michael Eavis and set up their own small little festival called ‘Glastonbury’. The rest is history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can hold my hands up and happily say that there is no other festival in the UK that can compete with Glastonbury. It is a festival known worldwide to appeal to all age groups and music tastes, one that does not just show the new up-and-coming artists but hosts the all-time greats such as David Bowie who attracted a crowd of 220,000 at the beginning of the millennium in 2000. No other festival has the entire weekend filmed by the BBC, enabling those who did not manage to snatch up a ticket to watch it from the comfort of their own home. This unique feature gives everyone the chance to listen to some incredible music, with the Sunday headline act of 2019 Kylie showcasing just how many people the festival can reach – a record number of 3.2million viewers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite going on sale in October and being priced at £248, tickets sell out in minutes, which just shows how much the festival has grown in popularity and size since its launch in 1970. Tickets were originally sold for just one pound and even included a pint of milk as little extra! The first festival attracted just 1,500 people, and forty-nine years later in 2019 figures show that the festival housed roughly 200,000 spectators. This is not at all surprising with a line-up including artists such as The Killers, Liam Gallagher, Loyle Carner, Maribou State, Wu-Tang Clan… the list goes on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, however, circumstances meant that everyone interested in the Glastonbury Festival would have no choice but to be watching from home. Who knew that the festival’s 50<sup>th</sup> year in the making,&nbsp;marking such a milestone in its creation, would be put on hold due to a global pandemic?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s half-century celebration was to be honoured with incredible artists Diana Ross, Elbow and Kendrick Lamar, all performing live on the Pyramid Stage. In an attempt to recreate what would have happened in Pilton, Somerset this weekend just gone, the Glastonbury website created a virtual line-up with <a href=\"https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/listen-to-our-john-peel-stage-2020-playlist/\">‘<strong>2020 main</strong></a> stage playlists’ which include a mix of tracks from different artists that would have been performing across the site. And instead of the usual live coverage of this year’s acts, we were treated to the <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/evrj6q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>BBC’s Glastonbury</strong></a><strong> </strong>Experience. Over the weekend the channel aired previous years’ headline acts and incredible Glastonbury debuts, with blasts from the past such as Bruce Springsteen, Adele, and Stormzy to name a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, from the 4<sup>th</sup> July pubs and restaurants are to open across England as lockdown starts to ease. And although this new freedom will give us a taste of what life was like pre-quarantine, it still shows us that we have a long way to go until we reach a stage where events such as Glastonbury, although outdoors, will be able to be held to the same level as they were before Covid-19 took over. This unfortunately poses the question of whether we will ever be able to return to that same level of comfort and laissez-faire attitude that one has when attending music festivals in the UK. Will shared coaches escorting people to and from the site be suspended? What will the health and safety policy be regarding portaloos? And, an aspect which is often a crucial element of the memories made is camping onsite &#8211; will festival goers ever be able to camp in such close quarters again?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This weekend’s virtual reminder of the Glastonbury Festivals of the past gave us a glimpse of what life was like before Covid-19 and a chance to reminisce and appreciate what all festival goers have taken for granted for years. Although, for now virtual festivals like the BBC’s Glastonbury Experience will be there to fill the void of the most popular outdoor events of the year and <em>hopefully</em> this content can reassure us of what life can be like <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/back-to-the-future-life-after-lockdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">again</a> at some point in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Grace Browne</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Give the article a rating below!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Write for us: <a href=\"mailto:stories@herdcommunity.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stories@herdcommunity.co.uk</a></em></h2>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/gracebrowne/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/622838b9b746d1af45a38bffc7494910?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Grace Browne\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/gracebrowne/\">Grace Browne</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

        "content": "\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The irrefutably challenging topic of chattel slavery has plagued North America and, of course, the world since its abolition in 1866 and has proved a topic of great discussion amidst the public. Naturally, this topic has prompted widespread public intrigue and thus historic slavery has been illustrated to the public through an extensive variety of mediums, namely motion picture. Subsequently, this begs the question how have films tackling slavery affected the way in which the public views this ‘peculiar institution’? Two such films who both tackle the subject of slavery, but have received contrasting responses, are Quentin Tarantino’s <em>Django </em>and Steve McQueen’s <em>12 Years a Slave.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tarantino’s <em>Django</em> offers a fictional, western revenge fantasy set against the backdrop of the American civil war and Southern chattel slavery. The plot follows newly-freed slave turned bounty hunter, Django, on his quest to free his still-enslaved wife; the protagonist embarks upon his journey alongside his white mentor and arguably ‘saviour’, Dr Schultz. Typical of a Tarantino western, the film is filled to the brim with scenes of bloodshed and gunfights, with Django eventually fulfilling his pursuit of freedom at the expense and deaths of those who have oppressed him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, although <em>Django</em> certainly does not fail to remind its audience of slavery’s brutal and turbulent nature, the film arguably feeds white ideals of ‘white saviourism’ and ‘white guilt’. Under the watchful eye of his white companion, Django takes revenge on his white captors and becomes the film’s hero. Likewise, throughout the picture Django continuously enacts vengeful violence on white slave-holders. This, coupled with the fact that Django is accompanied on his journey of retribution by the white Dr Schultz, holds no historical gain, but simply makes it an easier watch for those who reject contemporary white complicity. The complete rejection of historical accuracy provides a sense of redemption for contemporary audiences, providing both an unlikely slave-hero and simultaneous white protector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the historical inaccuracy of a slave becoming both bounty hunter and murderous hero, it seems the violence in <em>Django: Unchained </em>consequently renders the picture a more bearable experience for the general public. Indeed, critics and historians argue the concept of revenge and recurrent violent scenes enable the viewer to sit easier, watching a slave take action against his tyrants, rather than the more typical alternate scenario. Journalist Jelani Cobb argues the film “inverts” the typical slave and master relationship, ultimately creating a feeling of resolution amongst viewers. The violence explored in <em>Django</em> somewhat appeases the viewer and makes for a more enjoyable watch, unsurprising when taking into account the reality of its historical issues. Matthew Hughey similarly recognises Tarantino’s need to fill the white guilt led void, arguing “while <em>Django</em> had been billed as a black revenge fantasy, it fits comfortably within the white saviour genre”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, McQueen’s Oscar-winning masterpiece provides an accurate illustration of enslaved life in the ante-bellum South but is much less comforting for its audience. Based on the slave-narrative of Solomon Northrup, the film trails the tyranny its protagonist and his enslaved peers endured over the course of, obviously, twelve years. During the course of the film, viewers are forced into watching the hanging, lynching and whipping of different slaves, including the film’s protagonist himself, and thus are constantly met with the brutality of this era. It is evident that the director’s use of violence and abuse in a multitude of scenarios certainly has an effect on the audience in the sense that viewers must come to terms with slavery in the context of our contemporary society, one that has often tried to deny its true atrocities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McQueen’s picture seemingly has a comparable happy ending to that of Tarantino’s; Northrup reaches his eventual much deserved freedom and returns from the torment of the South to the safety of the more-liberal North. However, through another of his characters, the vulnerable slave-woman named Patsy, the director reminds us that Northrup is an exception. As his protagonist rides away to safety in the foreground, McQueen haunts his audience with the final image of Patsy collapsing in the backdrop. This ultimate scene reinforces the continuity of racial abuse suffered in the South and thus once again plunges the viewer straight back into a pit of distress. <em>12 Years</em> delivers a realistic depiction of slave-life in the South, and so enhances the knowledge of those who invest in its story, evidently in contrast with the result of <em>Django. </em>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprisingly, it appears that although the history of American slavery has been made more accessible to the wider public through these films, a certain taboo still encircles the subject. Indeed, James Horton, a specialist historian on the subject, has argued that “the tendency is to turn away from history that is upsetting”, and this is particularly true where McQueen’s picture is concerned. Evidently, despite a clear enhanced understanding of the subject surrounding both films, Tarantino’s film remains an easier watch as it does not force its audience to accept the horrors of slavery or consider the ramifications it has caused today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, both films undeniably have a positive impact on public opinion in the way that they respectively bring questions about slavery to the surface and implore the viewer to question the institution’s historical past. However, the discomfort that <em>12 Years</em> projects onto its viewers clearly points to the need for more understanding and better acceptance of the realities of America’s racial history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Ella Wallker </em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/ellawalker/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cdc07f08f57016bbe6de1218a5cdad37?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Ella Walker\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/ellawalker/\">Ella Walker</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

The video is beaming with colourful outfits, people bursting with laughter, bikinis on the beach and no one is two meters apart. This mood booster reminds us of the good times to come as we see dancing, kissing, hugging and happiness, and the glimmer of hope that reality seems to be approaching for us all this summer. The video’s opening title ‘dedicated to touch’ resonates with the viewer through the focus on physical pleasure whilst Harry Styles is keen to for us to remember the joy of being physically present. However Harry’s gentle Instagram reminder is not to be ignored: “Do not try this at home. Practice social distancing.” So for now, eating watermelons on a beach with friends will continue to remain a fantasy…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-instagram aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAVcrA7nwUr/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

His undeniable oozing confidence is contagious to the viewer and instantly handed over as the video ends. If Harry can enjoy experimenting with style and continue to wear his signature string of pearls and brightly coloured nails, then so can we. Harry has provided the ultimate summer inspiration and it is time to say good bye to the lockdown wardrobe. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we view Styles’ abundance of oversized sunglasses and crochet vets, we add them to our shopping lists and realise that we should be wearing whatever brings us joy. This is what makes the styling even more beautiful; the fact that the cast are care-free and having fun, and luckily for us, that is something we won’t be needing to add to any shopping list.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAVk0MeJBZd/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Do you call them out on it and risk upset or an argument? Do you try and make light of it or just brush it under carpet, even though that doesn’t feel right to you?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some tips on how you might be able to manage that awkward conversation:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Choose your moment</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Try not to react angrily if you hear a parent saying something you disagree with. Find a quieter time and place where you can speak calmly and rationally. If you can’t do that, or have to counteract their words straight away, do it without anger.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Talk about how you feel</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Telling them how you feel, when they say/do things you consider racist or racially biased is important. No one can be blamed for how they feel but it is important to consider how you act on your feelings, and if you need to challenge someone’s words this should be done with the aim of helping them to understand the impact of their words or attitudes. However, it is important to remember that, while it is acceptable to have discussions and opinions about race, outright hate speech, which stirs up racial hatred for example, and other forms of prejudiced behaviour may be a crime and can be prosecuted.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Ask them to clarify what they say</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>“</strong>When you say ‘xxxx’, what do you mean?” Don’t put words into their mouth, but you might want to ‘reflect’ their words back to them by quoting them directly. This gives them a chance to think about how their words are received by others and to open up a discussion where opinions can be aired and challenged on both sides.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Ask how they would react if they found themselves in the same situation</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p> Try to find out what their feelings would be if they were the person they are speaking negatively about. For instance, if they were being spoken to or about in a certain way or treated unfairly because of an aspect of their identity. While we can never put ourselves in the shoes of someone who is targeted by racist or discriminatory actions, we can begin to empathise and understand by thinking about how these actions affect them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that this is a huge issue that will not be solved overnight. Many racist attitudes and biases are the product of upbringing and a sense of <em>“that’s how it’s always been”</em>, and it is hard for people to let go of this and start thinking differently. But everyone taking a stand and considering their own unconscious (or conscious) bias will help to improve the social climate and create a fairer world for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Stop Hate UK</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stop Hate UK is one of the leading national organisations working to challenge all forms of Hate Crime and discrimination. <strong><a href=\"http://Stop Hate UK is one of the leading national organisations working to challenge all forms of Hate Crime and discrimination\">Visit their website</a></strong> or follow them on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/stop_hate_uk/\"><strong>Instagram</strong></a> to stay up the date with their continuing work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can donate to Stop Hate UK here: <a href=\"http://www.stophateuk.org/donate-to-stop-hate-uk/\">http://www.stophateuk.org/donate-to-stop-hate-uk/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Write for us: <a href=\"mailto:stories@herdcommunity.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stories@herdcommunity.co.uk</a></em></h2>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/stophateuk/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/67626242f590389d1109ff5a90a0d40a?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Stop Hate UK\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/stophateuk/\">Stop Hate UK</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Since leaving drama school, I have worked in the theatre environment for two and a half years. Not in the exact capacity I dream of, rather selling ice creams than doing the box splits on the Duke of York stage. That being said, I loved my job. I loved the secret lives of creatives serving the pints and cracking the jokes behind the bar. We were a team and I’m going to miss it hugely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone benefits from the arts. Whether it’s the Christmas treat to go to Coventry Belgrade or the dodgy one woman musical about an air hostess and her moon cup (if anyone’s done this, please link me tickets). Every single person, including the members of our government, benefit from the arts. Our work. So why is no one helping us? It’s like sending a Christmas card and being ghosted. In fact, they more than just benefit it, they rely on it. What do you do when you’re upset and need distracting? If you’re me, it’s a pint and Todaytix £10 seats at the back. So listen to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">huge</span>, I repeat <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">huge</span> network of people behind the stage creating theatre. Writers, directors, casting directors, stage managers, sound operators, sound designers, lighting designers, costume departments, theatre marketing teams, development teams, bar and kitchen staff, waiters, ushers etc etc etc. There is a large amount of people currently not sleeping because they don’t know where the next pay cheque is going to come. If it can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Side note: It is obviously heart breaking for theatre performers also at the moment. It’s heartbreaking to see on Twitter how many West End performers have just been told their next stage appearance will be in 2021. For performers a lot of the work happens off stage in classes, warm ups in public toilets on the way to auditions, a constant effort to keep up ones practise. So the legends who have to wait six months to get back to Hamilton or Wicked etc, I’m incredibly sorry. I too have been affected as a performer with my show being <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/fringe-to-fridge-micro-ambition-joe-exotic-and-writers-block-down/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rescheduled</a> for next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it is the people who help the magic happen off stage who are also in dire need of help. It’s the smaller, less established theatres who pride themselves on a ‘risky’, ‘daring’ programme who need the help. And will need it for the foreseeable future. I am worried where theatre is heading. Theatres which seek out new, diverse, unheard voices, I can only imagine will be faced with the decision of getting bums on seats with an established (let’s face it, male writer) or keeping up their ambition of launching unheard voices. Decisions will be more financially driven than an ethos-led. This is an assumption, she says shyly from the back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can all, obviously, be helped with a lovely huge cash injection from the Government, to ensure theatres can keep up furloughing staff. However, even if B.J. decides to dig deep, what are the practicalities of ‘safe’ theatre? The concept of social distancing in an audience is equivalent to a huge headless cow cartwheeling through a vegan cafe. Quite disturbing. Programmes which work hard to break down barriers between audience members, will their barriers all of a sudden have to go back up? I was in Tesco the other day in a face mask and farted in the yoghurt section. When I laughed, to myself, I inhaled my face mask and this big cloudy breath fogged up my glasses. I looked like a fool. So what will happen to comedies if laughing in face masks is so hard?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;I nearly fell through the floor when I saw an <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/news/andrew-lloyd-webber-theatre-reopen-uk-joseph-technicolour-dreamcoat-palladium-tickets-a9575041.html\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">article titled</a> “Andrew Lloyd Webber says government suggested musicals return ‘without any singing’.” Imagine robbing Vincent Van Gough of his paintbrush &#8211; would he start finger painting? Making pasta shell creations of the Queen (shout out to my year 3 pasta queen.) It seems, at the moment, there is just an avalanche of bad news for the theatre industry. But! I see hope.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are creatives. There were creatives in the caveman age, banging twigs on rocks, telling stories. Theatre and prostitution are some of the oldest industries around. Prostitution has no relevance to this, just a cool fact. If we could create theatre when the light bulb didn’t exist. Then we can create theatre, in inventive, and perhaps, more accessible ways. Outdoor theatre, smaller capacity theatre and situational theatre are all options which a) could be cheaper to ticket thus more inclusive for low income audience members, b) more compelling and interesting to watch c) won’t be shut down by policemen and d) really exciting to create.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I see light at the end of the tunnel I really do. And for new writers and actors coming out of drama school, there is a way out of this. And we all have to sit tight, keep creating and when the doors open, roar very loudly and fiercely. We will be back!!</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Julia Grogan</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Write for us: <a href=\"mailto:stories@herdcommunity.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stories@herdcommunity.co.uk</a></em></h2>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/juliagrogan/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/17c03cea9788795b021d8e0a9474342b?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Julia Grogan\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/juliagrogan/\">Julia Grogan</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

The events of the last few weeks demonstrate the power of collective unity. Roll through Notting Hill with a smile on your face but don’t forget where its roots lie, and the reason it was established. Namely, as a bastion of culture and resistance in response to the brutal killing of Antiguan immigrant; Kelso Cochrane in 1959, and wider systematic racial oppression. The events of the last few weeks, the tragedy of Grenfell tower, and the annual pre-emptive arrests serve as pertinent reminders that such foundations must never be overlooked. Unfortunately, COVID-19 looks set to disrupt Notting Hill proceedings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/07/notting-hill-carnival-2020-cancelled-coronavirus\">this year</a>. We urge the HERD to use the time to reflect, educating ourselves on the central causes, the people Carnival represents, and how both can be actively supported. Equality, justice, togetherness: the values of RDJ + NH carnivals are the same. How do the parties themselves compare? We went to Rio 2020 to find out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image1-2-1.jpeg?fit=640%2C640&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1527\" width=\"626\" height=\"625\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image1-2-1.jpeg?w=1194&amp;ssl=1 1194w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image1-2-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image1-2-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image1-2-1.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image1-2-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image1-2-1.jpeg?resize=500%2C500&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>LOCATION.</strong> Running since 1723 with over two million partygoers each year, Rio De Janeiro has a heavyweight history. The Carnival has traditionally religious significance, marking the celebration before the fasting season of lent. Parades, parties, and open-air stages. Casual doesn’t cut it. Everywhere you look, your senses are feasted with brightly coloured floats, vibrant dancers, and flamboyant live music. Across the Atlantic, Rhaune Laslett was instrumental for Notting Hill Carnival kick-off in 1966, and with one million attendees each year, the story is similar.&nbsp; Real street food, banging soundsystems, carnival buzz; not much changes. The better party venue? It’s hard to argue with Rio De Janeiro’s breath-taking natural beauty. The backdrop is genuinely ridiculous. Hot rain dropping did anything but dampen Brazilian spirits, nor decrease their spirit consumption. Picture Christ the Redeemer towering over the city, endless golden sandy beaches, and a tropical mountainous terrain cradling the pumping metropolis beneath it. This place is special; the perfect party destination.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image2-2.jpeg?fit=640%2C640&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Christ the Redeemer\" class=\"wp-image-1528\" width=\"638\" height=\"637\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image2-2.jpeg?w=1194&amp;ssl=1 1194w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image2-2.jpeg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image2-2.jpeg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image2-2.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image2-2.jpeg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image2-2.jpeg?resize=500%2C500&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ATMOSPHERE.</strong> The arrival of Carnaval do Rio de Janeiro evokes a real sense of anticipation. Having said that, the blocos are dispersed across the city, so you are not always surrounded by it all. But when you step into the place, the place is popping. Like at Notting Hill, we see colossal float parades, talented samba schools, and deafening drum sets. Over the recent years, Brazil has undergone a socio-political renaissance and what really struck us was the open celebration of LGBTQ+ communities – it’s a stronger sentiment than in the UK and wonderful to witness. Deep inside the dance, it&#8217;s simple enough to smash your way through espetinho kebabs, sink too many caipirinhas, and, if you’re lucky, secure a whine from a Brazilian grandma. However, flooded across the space, I’d say Notting Hill wins for atmosphere because you don’t have to move anywhere to find pure noise. We like that. Sweaty bouncing crowds, the constant smell of weed, and hundreds of thousands of empty noss canisters all add to the character of the London party we know and love. With a sturdy pair of old creps and Red Stripe in hand, you’re set to soak it all up in your stride. Rio puts a lot into the ‘official Carnival’ at the Sambódromo, which is quite the madness, but you have to pay-to-enter. Put on by the people, for the people, Notting Hill Carnival is centred around the city streets. For me, that’s what it’s all about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image3-2.jpeg?fit=640%2C640&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1529\" width=\"681\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image3-2.jpeg?w=1199&amp;ssl=1 1199w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image3-2.jpeg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image3-2.jpeg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image3-2.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image3-2.jpeg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image3-2.jpeg?resize=500%2C500&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WARDROBE.</strong> Fact &#8211; the people of Rio de Janeiro know how to curate a showstopping wardrobe. Skin is the costume of choice: boob, butt, belly everywhere you look. Weaving through the streets of the old town, it’s easy to see that creativity is key. From traditional Masquerade outfits, dazzling jewelled headdresses, iconic Brazilian football legends et al, the aesthetic is impossible to fault. In Rio, every spectator is a performer and we were markedly under(over)dressed; Maharishi doesn&#8217;t cut the mustard when tutus are the norm. Thankfully, the girls we were with absolutely smashed it with their Carni garms. Widespread commitment to rocking head-turning attire is the Brazilian way; no complaints there. The attractive people of RDJ embellish themselves in paint, encrust their skin in rhinestone, and grow majestic wings. South America is brought to life. The look sets the scene for the prevailing party, and the seats of Rio subway are truly blessed to score a VIP view. Costumes are fire; confidence is king.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image4.jpeg?fit=640%2C640&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Rio de Janeiro carnival \" class=\"wp-image-1530\" width=\"675\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image4.jpeg?w=1208&amp;ssl=1 1208w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image4.jpeg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image4.jpeg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image4.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image4.jpeg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image4.jpeg?resize=500%2C500&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>SOUNDSYSTEMS.</strong> These are the beating heart of Notting Hill. Since its inception, the event has championed Caribbean Culture. From rum punch to Red Stripe, to the five tonnes of Jerk Chicken knocked back every year; but the real focus is on the music. Silky soft soca sounds and velvety origins in dub, calypso and ska reggae are at the core of Notting Hill Carnival. Though, things have evolved over the years and, for better or worse, now we see more eclectic line-ups across genres. The music in Rio is more of an acquired taste. You have a choice: it’s Samba, or Samba. Percolating sounds ring through your ears into the night yet the acoustic focus still doesn’t size up against the West London daddy. Inspired heavily by Trinidadian Carnival, London sees soundsystem collectives coming together to shut the show down. The sound is so sophisticated: amplifiers, processors, turntables, mixers, amps, speakers (bass, mid, top); it’s just enormous! Food is an immense part of both carnivals, but only the London soundsystems will properly feed your ears. With a few tinnies and a positive attitude, you’re set for a legendary Ladbroke rave. The beats, they bang.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image5.jpeg?fit=640%2C640&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"London Notting Hill Carnival\" class=\"wp-image-1531\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Perennial community atmosphere, cultural celebrations, sweat-licked day parties, aching legs, and hefty hangovers are characteristics of both carnivals. The annual festivals are quite rightly part of the DNA for those at the heart of carnival heritage either side of the Atlantic. So, who takes the crown? I have to say Notting Hill. With unbelievable soundsystems and stadium-like atmosphere, the West London two-day party produces every time. Head to Rio de Janeiro if you can, we loved it. The city is electric, and Carnival is the belly of the beast. It encapsulates everything magical about this special place.&nbsp; When things re-open here in the UK, the best party of the year will not fail to deliver. We need Carnival now more than ever. <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/a-brief-history-of-british-colonialism-and-its-contemporary-repercussions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Educate</a>, act, amplify: meaningfully get behind its root causes and the people at its core. Know that it will rain sunshine on the streets of Notting Hill once more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Zack Santos</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Write for us: <a href=\"mailto:stories@herdcommunity.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stories@herdcommunity.co.uk</a></em></h2>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/zacksantos/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7be245fd08fd3fef472e89ad605cc01d?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Zack Santos\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/zacksantos/\">Zack Santos</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

We human beings certainly have a peculiar propensity to fantasise about extreme wealth. This is so that we can prepare ourselves for the inevitable day when we miraculously transform into Donald Duck (another flappy cousin of the Magpie) and dive head first and clumsily into a pool of our own glistening and infinite wealth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our peculiar fetish for fortunes has resulted in the maintenance of league tables for the rich. From the Forbes 400 to The Sunday Times Rich List one thing is clear: billionaires are idolised. These league tables help governments monitor the amount of money in the pockets of its citizens and helps its citizens to measure who has got the biggest boat. Not that fortune is all plain sailing. The only time you’re likely to bear witness to an advert for a rehab clinic will probably be in Forbes Magazine. The luxurious, boozeless clinic will no doubt be located in Switzerland and have a sauna the size of Liechtenstein.

Avarice (for those who don’t know a Scrooge) is the insatiable desire to gain and hoard wealth. In the time of Corona, as pay packets shrink, job vacancies plummet and global unemployment spikes, the wealth gap will continue to widen. So, is it a good idea to gawp at other peoples’ extreme wealth in these flamboyant rich lists? Potentially.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a start, most governments don’t track wealth on a global scale. So rich lists might be the best metrics we have for trying to understand the true value of the world’s most well-off. Once this is known publicly, it might deter billionaires from trying to stash their money in tax havens. Leaks like the Panama Papers reveal the lengths that some of the wealthiest in society will go to hide their money and avoid paying their way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Included in the Rich List, there’s also a Tax List, to document those with the highest tax bills in the United Kingdom. Last year, JK Rowling paid <a href=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/harry-potter-author-jk-rowling-21366970\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">£48.6 million</a> income tax on her £100 million earnings. She was a single mother living on benefits when she wrote the first Harry Potter book. Those experiences guide her attitudes to income tax.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rich are often (rightfully) chastised for not coughing up their fair share in tax, but by recording and highlighting those that do, an example can be set to the tax dodgers: Despite requesting a £500 million pound loan from the British Government to bail out Virgin Airways, <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/the-richard-branson-dilemma/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Richard Branson</a> has paid no income tax in the UK for 14 years. He is estimated to be worth well over £3.6 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Millionaires can do some very impressive things with their wealth, sometimes more impressive than governments. For example, <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/tesla-best-bet-of-the-decade/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Elon Musk</a> founded Tesla, which has normalised the everyday use of fully electric cars and he launched SpaceX to expand interplanetary exploration. As if that wasn’t enough, Musk also founded PayPal and ‘at least’ six other companies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The very richest can take the largest risks, gambles that a government doesn’t want to make with its taxpayers&#8217; money. The man who hoovered up the top spot of this year’s wealth review, Sir James Dyson (estimated worth £16.2 Billion) lost £500 million in his attempt to crack the electric car but still tops the list. That optimism and ambition will be needed for our worldwide economy to recover from this global slump.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wonderfully, to supplement the Rich List this year, there was also a Giving List. Rihanna made a £15 million-pound donation to Coronavirus relief efforts. Dyson spent £20 million on creating ventilators that will be used to fight Covid-19. The British grime artist Stormzy, funds scholarships for black students to go to Cambridge. This is believed to have played a significant role in increasing the University’s black student admissions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s the nice thing about being extremely wealthy, you’re really able to encourage positive action. In fact, in 2017 the UK’s 300 biggest givers donated more than £3.2bn to good causes. And at least 200 of the world’s 2,000 billionaires have signed the Giving Pledge, where they vow to give over half of their wealth away to philanthropic causes before they die.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, only 3 pages out of 135 were dedicated to the Giving List in this year’s Sunday Times Rich List. This has to change. The Giving List is something we should covet. And celebrate even more vigorously than its contorted cousin. Truly forward-thinking and conscientious innovators who invest charitably deserve their place on the pedestal. Those oligarchs who pump money perpetually into oil, tobacco and slave labour do not. So watch this space. And by this space, I mean the Giving List.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image3-e1592813863314-1024x768.jpeg?resize=616%2C458&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1519\" width=\"616\" height=\"458\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image3-e1592813863314.jpeg?zoom=2&amp;resize=616%2C458&amp;ssl=1 1232w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image3-e1592813863314.jpeg?zoom=3&amp;resize=616%2C458&amp;ssl=1 1848w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Caspar Barnes</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/casparbarnes/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/451c66e4edc94eef5ca562047168c717?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Caspar Barnes\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/casparbarnes/\">Caspar Barnes</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

The Prime Ministers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/23/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-boris-johnson-minister-condemns-people-ignoring-two-metre-distance-rule-in-parks-as-very-selfish\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">address to the nation</a> confirmed what was before the nightmarish stuff of folklore and rumour; that a national Lockdown would commence. No parks, no beaches, no pubs. I think in my wildest Dirty Dancing fantasies, this summer was undoubtedly supposed to be the best few months of my life. This was the summer where I would have countless boozy picnics on beaches fringing declining seaside towns; the summer in which a lead singer in a band, spotted me in the crowd, pulled me up on stage and kissed me to the rapturous applause of my fellow teenage girls. This was the summer which I would look back on when I was wrinkled and revel in photos of my golden youth and naive foppery. I was supposed to conquer this summer, stick a flag in this summer and declare to the world that being tanned was one small step for me, but one giant leap for my sex appeal. As it currently stands, I am having three showers a day and pacing my garden like a depressed tiger in an RSPCA uncertified enclosure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The loss of time is a bewildering notion to fathom. I suppose for the 16-25-year age category, the sands of time running through our fingers is especially devastating, as the cultural imaginary dictates that these are the golden years. You are old enough to make your own decisions (have baths at 1 am, drink yourself into a stupor etc.), but also young enough to run rampant down streets screaming yourself hoarse without being institutionalised. But it is difficult to mourn the loss of time when such devastating human loss is taking place. It feels egoistic to allow ourselves to feel blue, because we are perpetually aware of how lucky we are; that we have a garden for example, or that we get on well with our family. But you are absolutely allowed to wallow. It’s a different kind of suffering, of course, and we are painfully aware that people are suffering on scale entirely incomparable to our own, but this doesn’t necessarily mean that we should deny ourselves the right to be sad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many of us this period of time has mentally metamorphosed into the summer that ‘could have been’, and in various ways we have sensationalised our hypothetically incredible summers, dreaming up hopelessly unrealistic theoretic experiences which were unlikely ever to materialise (although one day I shall undoubtedly be kissed by a Rockstar). But perhaps lockdown was a blessing in disguise, like not being able to go to a mates party, only for it to transpire that the party ran out of alcohol at 11 and the mates uncle (who consumed ¾ of the alcohol on offer) was dancing topless on a table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example; the lack of FOMO. I am joylessly bound by the fear of missing out most days of the year; worried about not getting tickets to the best nights out, or simply from seeing peoples Instagram posts on exotic palmed beaches surrounded by aquamarine seas. I suppose the slightly glorious thing about Lockdown is that we are all in a similar state of stasis; of perpetual uncertainty, and to look for a silver lining in this otherwise unbalanced time is to feel slightly liberated by the fact that we aren’t missing out on anything other than a hypothetic reality. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;The joy of going to the post office practically matches the feeling of singing obnoxiously loudly on a pool table&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Being thrown haphazardly into a brave new world of crackly zoom calls and infinite pub quizzes has also radically altered what we perceive as ‘a good time’. We need to get our teenage kicks from somewhere else. I have already cut my bangs from home (a horrible, horrible idea; its not, I REPEAT NOT, as easy as it looks on Facebook), but the thrill it gave me was analogous to the feeling of skinny dipping in a lake. Getting a pint of milk from the corner shop evokes a similar feeling to attending a wedding (the pleasantries exchanged are worryingly similar). The joy of going to the post office practically matches the feeling of singing obnoxiously loudly on a pool table. Just think how low the greasy, metaphorical bar of a good night out will be once this is all over. I could be crying into a stained serviette at a kebab joint in Brixton at 2 am and it would still be a glorious. It would be extraordinarily liberating.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps what has become blindingly obvious over the last few weeks is our almost primal desire for human interaction. The pandemic has sparked questions as to whether all meetings in the future will be conducted via Zoom, and whether people <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/laurie-lees-spanish-journey-is-a-tonic-for-lockdown-claustrophobia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">will now think twice about travelling</a> or meeting up; ‘a new normal’, as its been branded. But having recently seen friends, it occurs to me how utterly miraculous it is that we crave physical human interaction with such fervency. The view of someone’s side profile for example, or the way they fidget with their hair. Its something you cannot achieve over a 2D virtual call. You become anesthetised to the idiosyncrasies of people; like watching them sip from a can, how they smoke a cig, how they laugh. All these tiny little eccentricities that we ignore on a day to day basis become so inherently important. They are what make us <em>us</em>. Yes, you can superficially keep up to date with someone virtually, but you miss all the minute details which make them <em>them.</em> All the individual quirks that on a fundamentally chemical level make humans attract other humans. To see someone in the flesh after a period of separation is to suddenly become re aware of all the things you loved about them. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, to quote ‘The Courteneers’, “I know it seems strange but things they change”. Nothing is permanent. We haven’t lost time; we’ve merely spent it in a different way than how we initially imagined. Life as we knew it, will slowly sputter back to normal. We are all cogs in a well-oiled machine. Perhaps we might even long for a time when cutting our hair seemed like the most wonderful idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Maisie Ringer</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/maisieringer/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/aecdc0cd9db876b8c18603e7a744aa80?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Maisie Ringer\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/maisieringer/\">Maisie Ringer</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Over 80 days of being anchored in one place. Almost three months of diminished freedoms (trips to Durham excluded). Thankfully, Covid-19 has begun to relax its grip on the country. Alongside the undoubtedly more serious problems of the economy, the bereaved and the <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/black-lives-cannot-stop-mattering-lets-keep-the-conversation-going/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Black Lives Matter</a> protests, it leaves a nation itching for the freedom to get out and travel. The government’s easing of isolation rules has begun to release some of this pent-up frustration. And yet, across the UK, summer lies in tatters with any future travel plans looking uncertain or, at the very least, restricted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a tonic to your cabin-fever I present: the travel book! The vaccine you never knew you needed and a substitute for the travel you so dearly wanted. This series will consider a few of my favourites, in the hope they become a few of yours…</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong>Laurie Lee, ‘As I Walked Out One Midsummer’s Morning’</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png?resize=250%2C165&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1482\" width=\"250\" height=\"165\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><em><em>Lee’s journey from Vigo to Almuñécar, as stitched by my step-sister for my step-father, hanging in my mum’s house</em></em>.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>‘As I Walked Out’ follows the wanderings of a 19-year-old Lee as he travels through Spain in the 1930s. Arriving in the top left corner of the peninsula, he crosses from the Gothic north of the country, through the scorched Castilian plains, before entering the Moorish south and Andalusia. Travelling on foot, armed only with his violin, a change of clothes and the Spanish for “can I have a glass of water?”, he plays for his supper and sleeps where he drops. Lee imparts to the reader images of an undeveloped, anarchic Spain. Marbella is still a fishing village, and the country moves to ‘rhythms unchanged since the days of Hannibal’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, his journey taking place from 1935-1936, this Spain is one stumbling towards a bloody civil war. One can trace the origins of the conflict through Lee’s journey, as a sense of disquiet in the streets grows into whispers of dissent in the south before war in actuality is declared. Lee allies himself to the republican effort in the small fishing village of Almuñécar, before being whisked away to safety by a passing Royal Navy vessel. This hands-on approach is one he adopts throughout his journey. Always involved, rarely a watchful observer, it is this immersion that allows him to create such a personable and vivid portrait of a country’s final days before civil war would change it forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-1.png?resize=139%2C212&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1483\" width=\"139\" height=\"212\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-1.png?zoom=2&amp;resize=139%2C212&amp;ssl=1 278w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-1.png?zoom=3&amp;resize=139%2C212&amp;ssl=1 417w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 139px) 100vw, 139px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><em>My step-father’s first edition. He’s pretty into Laurie Lee.&nbsp;</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;‘As I Walked Out’ is one of my favourite books. Less for its portrait of Spain than for Lee’s attitude toward life and travel in general. He describes setting out from his Gloucester home buoyed by a ‘confident belief in good fortune’, and this sense of optimism pervades his journey. He doesn’t plan or worry but works things out as he goes along. He takes the decision to visit Valladolid ‘not because [he knows] anything about it, but because [he] liked the sound of its syllables’, and if he isn’t invited into the homes of locals, he happily sleeps outside. All the better to enjoy the morning…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lee’s approach is slow-paced and spontaneous. He describes feeling ‘so fat with time, so free of the need to be moving or doing’ that he might find himself ‘[f]or hours [watching] some manic ant dragging a piece of orange peel through the grass’. This decidedly unhurried approach is reflected in his decision to walk from place to place and, married with his whimsical spontaneity, comes together to form a charming attitude toward the world. It is this attitude, combined with the small but flexible income available to him through busking, which serves to infuse the book with a sense of almost limitless freedom. And yet, this chilled-out, stripped-back approach to travel is countered by exciting moments of genuine danger, whether they be wild dog attacks or naval bombardments, heat stroke or snowy mountain passes. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-2.png?resize=331%2C255&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Laurie Lee\n\" class=\"wp-image-1484\" width=\"331\" height=\"255\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-2.png?zoom=2&amp;resize=331%2C255&amp;ssl=1 662w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-2.png?zoom=3&amp;resize=331%2C255&amp;ssl=1 993w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><em>Albarrachín, not actually visited by Lee, but looking very sugar-cube-like and pink.</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>All this makes for a truly captivating read but what sets this book aside for greatness, in my eyes, is its poetry. I actually think Lee’s grasp over language is unrivalled. Using simple words, he creates vivid images which beautifully convey the concept he is trying to transfer to the reader. He describes the ‘ancient, eroded, red-walled town’ of Toro, sitting atop ‘gigantic shelves of rock’ in the distance, as looking like ‘dried blood on a rusty sword’. Cadiz, on the horizon, is ‘a city of sharp incandescence, a scribble of white on a sheet of blue glass, lying curved on the bay like a scimitar and sparkling with African light’. He conjures images of timeless Spanish villages, perched on their rocky outcrops, describing them as ‘piles of squat houses like cubes of pink sugar’. The Spanish language is relayed on separate occasions as sounding like: ‘[a] dry throaty rattle of pebbles being rolled down a gulley’, the ‘firing off [of] metallic bursts of speech that bounced off rocks like bullets’, and ‘like a clashing of knives on stone’. In Lee’s Spain, old crone’s needles ‘dart like silver fish’ and one’s only relief from the Iberian sun, ‘the brass-taloned lion which licks the afternoon ground’, is the luxuriant shade where one can ‘slip off the heat like a sweat-soaked shirt’.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laurie Lee is first ‘propelled’ from his country home by his ‘cottage walls narrowing like the arms of an iron-maiden’. This sense of confinement, of stifling claustrophobia, is one we can all relate to at the moment. Lee’s solution, although not to available to us, makes for a pretty great read in the circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Will Bruce</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/willbruce/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e614ed2c8783c4c620801627b415b481?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Will Bruce\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/willbruce/\">Will Bruce</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

I think at this point I’d heard the news but after feeling pretty sick to my stomach a couple of weeks before hearing about the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/ahmaud-arbery-former-police-officer-and-son-charged-in-shooting-of-black-man\">Ahmaud Arbery</a>, I remember thinking I didn&#8217;t want to be sat staring at a screen again, going over and over how it is possible that so much hatred and violence could be stirred up in reaction to the colour of someone&#8217;s skin. The colour of my skin. But this time I didn&#8217;t have a choice. It was not just my friend who was incensed that another American Black man had lost his life due to police brutality. Within a week the whole world had suddenly seemed to wake up to the fact that fifty years on we are still dealing with the same problems of inequality and prejudice and that systemic racism is real, and not just prevalent in the US.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a win. There is absolutely no denying that. But there are elements of this wakeup call which seem bittersweet. There are elements which are also alarming. As someone who is mixed-race, I’ve come to realise (during this current movement and before) that I’m often searching for some kind of middle ground in conversations about race. Like I have to choose a side when really we should all be on the same one. I find myself searching for reasons why things might not be racist, because I want to see a light at the end of the tunnel. I don&#8217;t want to be pushed into a position that causes me to feel any resentment and anger to any ‘group’ in society, and on top of this, the ‘group’ that is half of my DNA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This movement is forcing me to interrogate this in a very draining way. I don&#8217;t know if I want people asking me if I’m ‘ok’ or coming to me to vent to me about racist relatives. Since social media has propelled the Black Lives Matter movement to the mainstream, I cannot scroll through Instagram, Twitter or Facebook, without seeing something which reminds me that there is black and there is white. I said before that the raised awareness of systemic racism is a win, but with this raised awareness there also seems to be some agonizingly regressive opinions coming to the fore. In the rush to become an ‘ally’ many white people are missing the point of the movement. I find myself frustrated at this caption or statement going around: ‘I understand that I will never understand, but I stand’. <em>I understand</em> the intention of this statement; showing solidarity whilst not claiming to have gone through the same experiences. But I can&#8217;t help feeling like it&#8217;s a cop out. How can you stand for something you don&#8217;t understand? And how can you not understand when the last few weeks there has been a constant barrage of resources explaining what racism is and why it is ingrained in society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me ‘allyship’ does not go hand in hand with people not understanding. I can&#8217;t really accept that or my family, my mixed-race family has to exist with this rather large elephant in the room. That we can&#8217;t understand (or even try to understand) each other&#8217;s experiences. The possible lack of true understanding is undermining the Black Lives Matter movement. White people taking photoshoots in protests, having street parties, or<a href=\"https://www.insider.com/black-lives-matter-i-cant-breathe-makeup-tiktok-trend-blackface-2020-6\"> </a><strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.insider.com/black-lives-matter-i-cant-breathe-makeup-tiktok-trend-blackface-2020-6\" target=\"_blank\">blackfacing on TikTok</a></strong>, all justified under the banner of ‘Black Lives Matter’. Again, I try to reason with this, at least they’ve paid attention, and at least they might be raising attention? Overshadowing this is the performativity of these things. This doesn’t feel like an attempt to understand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe it is hard to talk about racism when for most of your life it has not been on your radar. It&#8217;s hard to speak out when you&#8217;re afraid of saying the wrong thing or having your actions attacked. I don&#8217;t believe that it is wrong to criticise performative behaviour in relation to the Black Lives Matter movement, however some of the virtue signalling I am seeing on the internet has my heart sinking and I&#8217;m feeling despondent that we will ever truly be able to work together in fighting this fight.&nbsp; I have seen Black activists tearing down not just white people for their attempts but also other minorities of colour and mixed-race people. Why is it turning into a competition as to who is the most qualified to talk about racism, rather than a movement to band together to distinguish the racists from the anti-racist <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/14/ibram-x-kendi-on-why-not-being-racist-is-not-enough\" target=\"_blank\">(<strong>it is not enough to just ‘not be racist’ anymore</strong></a>). I will never personally experience the fear and weight of being a Black man in America, but that man could be my Dad, my Brother, my Uncle, my boyfriend, my friend. This is the same for many white people. I am optimistic that white allyship goes beyond performativity for this reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am optimistic for other reasons. In the past few weeks, I have had conversations with white friends which I never imagined I would be having for fear of causing awkwardness, or for fear of highlighting my differences. But I have never felt such willingness to listen before, a <em>willingness to understand and not just stand. </em>I remember when my (white) Mum first saw Reni Eddo-Lodge’s book ‘Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race’. Before any of us had read or understood what it was about, she seemed visibly upset or irritated. This is understandable, why would she want to be excluded from a topic which my family cannot remove themselves from? But Eddo-Lodge goes on to explain:<em> ‘</em><em>I’m no longer engaging with white people on the topic of race. Not all white people, just the vast majority who refuse to accept the existence of structural racism and its symptoms’.</em><em>&nbsp; </em>This acceptance is the beginning and if there is any main positive to draw from recent events it is that this level of acceptance appears to be growing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t hear much about the UK having a civil rights movement.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t want this movement that&#8217;s happening right now to be forgotten like the rest of <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/a-brief-history-of-british-colonialism-and-its-contemporary-repercussions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Black British history</a>. Surely, the best way to do this is to keep it in the voices of as many people as possible – whatever the colour. So, whilst it is unusual and sometimes uncomfortable to see so many people talking about race right now, I welcome it. Black Lives Matter is not a Black person&#8217;s movement, not a mixed-race person&#8217;s movement, not a white person&#8217;s movement, it’s humanity’s movement – one that we should all be owning at this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Georgia Mulraine</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/georgiamulraine/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/96ece8cad121443ed7ec492fe2b344c2?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Georgia Mulraine\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/georgiamulraine/\">Georgia Mulraine</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Racial injustice in 2020 is no longer a fundamentally black problem. It is now a white problem. Our most recent reminders – the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Regis Korchinski-Paquet, Breonna Taylor – while abhorrently despicable for us black people, are sadly not all that surprising. Whilst also affecting our self-esteem and mental health, the issues and racial microaggressions we, as black people, face on a daily basis can make our lives feel like a daunting task.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thinking ‘not another race post’ after just 16 days does not eliminate over 400 years of oppression. We must all understand that this fight for justice and equality is ongoing and does not end with 2 weeks of Instagram posts. This is a battle that I don’t have the luxury to take a back seat on. I understand that for some who may have been largely unaware of the ongoing negative impacts of racism, it can be a lot to digest all at once. There is no excuse at this point to be ignorant in regard to this issue &#8211; black people are dying at a disproportionate rate. It is imperative that momentum is not lost and more pressure is put on the system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Martin Luther King&#8217;s 1967 speech reminds us that if we are to ‘condemn rioting for the destructive, unbridled, and rageful aggression that it is, or more importantly, to try to prevent it from happening in the first place, we have to first understand its cause. Rioting can be thought of as a symptom of a disease. In order to treat the symptom, we have to treat the disease’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The root cause of the disease in this case is the systemic racism that has persisted across multiple generations, spanning hundreds of years. Dr. King, we can see, once identified this issue, yet on social media people are repeatedly condemning rioters and looters without wanting to comprehend the core issue at hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would appear that in other <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/05/22/brits-fight-street-malaga-two-days-pubs-reopen-12743940/\">similar situations</a> where football hooligans or the stragglers at the end of a night out can freely damage public and personal property for non-political gain, the same outrage is not directed at them and their vandalism. Usually they are awarded excuses like: ‘it’s just for a laugh’ or ‘one too many drinks’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be more concerned that ‘protests shouldn&#8217;t turn into looting’ is to be less concerned about the black lives that have been lost. It is being enraged at the wrong issue. Put simply, arrests should not result in murder. There are no excuses for the oppressed who have reached their wits end fighting for equality for yet another generation. Telling us to heal without justice is telling us to conform. In 2020, I believe it’s time to define a new normal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some things are worth fighting for. The life of an innocent human being, regardless of race, is most certainly worth more than looted goods. We are currently witnessing a revolution and, to quote John F. Kennedy, ‘those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, the movement’s measurable impact on the political and legal landscape is undeniable. It must be noted that in just over 2 weeks we have already accomplished the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Invaluable donations worldwide to a number of worthy causes. Please contribute in any way you can.</li><li>The arrest of all police officers involved in the murder of George Floyd. Furthermore, Derek Chauvins’ charges were upgraded to 2nd degree murder and his bail raised from 750,000 to 1.2m.</li><li>Breonna Taylor’s case was reopened for investigation.</li><li>Louisville suspends No-Knock warrants in light of the Breonna Taylor case.</li><li>Countless statues of slave traders being uprooted and torn down around the world.</li><li>Many US organisations, such as universities, cut ties with their local police force.</li><li>US marine corps banned all public displays of the confederate flag.</li><li>A new bill has been passed in response to Amy Cooper, now making it a hate crime to call 911 with a false allegation based on race.</li><li>Maybe the most poignant of all: Minneapolis City Council Members have announced their intent to disband the Minneapolis Police Department in place of community-led public safety.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all <em>great</em> things. And that is to name only a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It is possible to make the right changes &#8211; let’s continue to do so.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my fellow black people that may be reading this article: I know that this has been an unbelievably difficult time so please take some time out to indulge in some self-care, do things that bring you joy. Learn <em>that</em> Tiktok dance, cook or order yourself <em>that</em> extravagant meal, get dressed in <em>that</em> super boujie outfit to do your weekly shopping. Your mental wellbeing is extremely important in these unprecedented times. Remember that in spite of what we have gone &#8211; and continue &#8211; to go through, our black joy and laughter is one of our most glorious gifts to the world. From this, we have created illustrious talents and art within our culture that will continue to influence the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure to take care of yourself. I encourage absolutely everyone to make a habit of checking the BlackJoy hashtag. I promise that it will lift your spirits to no end. Black joy in general is an act of resistance that is important for us to highlight. Be involved in the revolution of our joy as well as the fight for our human rights and equality. We must celebrate black joy because black lives do not only matter in retrospect. Share our joy along with our plight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the white people reading this: use your privilege for change and educate yourself. <em>Don’t just listen to respond, listen to understand</em>. The last 2 weeks have been quite exhausting, frustrating and triggering for us, so having to discuss this topic time and time again with you when it is not our job can be further exhausting, frustrating and triggering. Do your own research and remember Google <em>is</em> your friend. There is a plethora of information at our fingertips &#8211; put it to good use! Actively reject the old normal to accept a new one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are currently witnessing the largest civil rights movement in history, spanning across all 50 states in the US, and over 18 countries globally. The world is currently protesting in solidarity of the Black Lives Matter movement. To some, this might sound dramatic &#8211; but let me be clear; if you’re not with us, you’re against us. It simply won&#8217;t cut it to take the claim of neutrality, so I urge privileged Caucasians to challenge themselves to have that uncomfortable discussion, because this is where the change begins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have included some online petitions that still need more signatures.

This has brought issues of race and education to the forefront of mainstream discussion, and many <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/a-brief-history-of-british-colonialism-and-its-contemporary-repercussions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>brilliant pieces</strong></a> have been written which explore the role of education regarding slavery and colonialism, particularly in the UK. Schooling undoubtedly plays a huge role in the formation of racism from an early age, but another major area of indoctrination occurs within the mainstream media.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stereotypical beliefs, of any sort, are not present from birth. Instead these stereotypes are learned through engaging in the social world. Of course, stereotypes exist about virtually every social group: English people all drink tea, the Germans have no sense of humour. Whilst these characterisations are largely tongue-in-cheek and not all that damaging, problems occur when those in dominant societal positions stereotype those who have little or no power to counteract such aspersions. As <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233233037_Stereotypes_in_the_Media_So_What\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Bradley Gorham has explained:</strong></a> “those who are in a dominant social position have the power to define the dominant understandings”, therefore possessing the capability “to make their definitions appear natural and unarguable”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The elite groups within society (politicians, CEO’s, newspaper editors) are responsible for controlling the discourse in various areas of debate and, as these positions are consistently held by rich white men, this often leads to the misrepresentation of those who do not fit this demographic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Edward Said wrote when discussing the representation of the East within Western culture: “it is hegemony that gives Orientalism it’s strength”. The lack of voice given to ‘outsiders’ in mainstream discourse reinforces the power relations societal groups, exacerbating the divide between them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Language_Power_and_Ideology.html?id=qUOHkLr6cg4C&amp;redir_esc=y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Studies have shown</strong></a> that the news generally pays far less attention to minority groups. The exceptions to this rule are where ethnic groups are “associated with violence, illegality, or…deviance of any kind”. <a href=\"http://discourses.org/download/articles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Teun Van Dijk’s analysis</strong></a> shows how crimes committed against ethnic minorities are afforded far less coverage; part of an overall strategy he describes as “mitigating the negative representation of ‘Us’ and the positive representation of ‘Them’”.&nbsp; Other negative portrayals, regularly assigned to minorities include being ‘welfare cheats’, hostile to western values, and posing an existential threat to ‘our’ way of life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/113/1/Schlesinger_The_social_organisation_of_news_production.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Phillip Schlesinger’s research</strong></a> of BBC News’ production practices in the early 1970’s found that the general newsworthiness of a disaster could be determined by a horrifically racist formula regarding the societal group of the casualties: “one thousand w**s = fifty frogs = one Briton”. Whilst such overt forms of racism may no longer hold firm in establishment media circles, the principle of assigning more journalistic weight to stories affecting white Britons has far from diminished.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gC57i4TiMDZaq-tabBlS-Yx2fjYSMNSfyfGcNn9RJ1rDIG0yWRdI1s_97rlyCQJhCtcXF-HlRC0fgXcDZq5COloVTOFjD7MphDAbMYfM0GsDt6RmofwnkFoxUZ2mbVzwgq8Bjuni\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Producing a conception of British identity, is an important aspect of the UK Press’ racial stereotyping. <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2012/09/mad-dogs-and-englishmen-stuart-hall-on-englishness/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Stuart Hall highlights tha</strong></a><a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2012/09/mad-dogs-and-englishmen-stuart-hall-on-englishness/\">t</a>, in the British context, the conception of ‘Englishness’ is often reproduced through media texts. The media have frequently <a href=\"http://resourcelists.ntu.ac.uk/items/4FA48E79-22CD-5850-53CC-C350816CD7C0.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>used the conception</strong></a> of Britain “as an idea rather than a geographical place”, meanwhile claiming that this “idea” is being attacked. There are numerous examples of this, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Q7JjDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT282&amp;lpg=PT282&amp;dq=richard+littlejohn+ashamed+of+their+own+nationality&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rZIx5Pa0sN&amp;sig=ACfU3U0k7crCWBEGXB2ptaetJQQFTxKbAQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi2veXcjPXpAhUFQUEAHeBFD9AQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ\">including</a> Minette Marrin’s direct claim that “English identity is under threat” and Richard Littlejohn’s argument that the ‘new establishment’ (liberal elites) are “ashamed of their own nationality”.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the 2016 referendum campaign, the pro-Leave media (Daily Mail, The Sun, Daily Express, The Telegraph) often played on racial fears to make their arguments in favour of Brexit. Although I don’t want to argue that the entire Leave campaign was built on racism, in my opinion it is obvious that racist rhetoric played a part in winning over some voters.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/fj6SUFK_mwfGU1DxEp1-nJiq5k2o_IyoJRCeX84UM3AuK79fHhlepVY-m3Hk1COp5jwmwuSxYIQf7obPNz0ltNFEqqPsrb3RwK1pxMNW4X-JuOV_hPgWC5iubS9zelrwCeb4DH4J\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Such race-baiting was even more apparent in tabloid coverage of Prince Harry’s engagement to Meghan Markle, an African-American woman. As <a href=\"https://www.trtworld.com/europe/meghan-markle-headlines-in-uk-tabloids-a-lesson-in-british-racism-17669\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>others have highlighted</strong></a>, stereotypes about black people “coming from broken homes…were weaponised by the British Press”, as Meghan did not fit the traditional, conservative conception of an English Princess. Incredibly,<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3896180/Prince-Harry-s-girlfriend-actress-Meghan-Markles.html)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong> the Daily Mail ran</strong></a> with the headline “Harry’s Girl is (almost) straight outta Compton”, not-so-subtly suggesting a link to gangs and crime. This material is illustrative of the wider treatment which people of colour face within the right-wing press.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Football has by no means managed to escape the spectre of racist discourse which occurs throughout much of society.<strong> <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=r9aTBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT75&amp;lpg=PT75&amp;dq=English+football+and+its+various+stakeholders+were+associated+with+a+pattern+of+whiteness+cleland&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YYTCmbPyE2&amp;sig=ACfU3U2Tvjxh7wToY1e097JDJJcnaT2kKg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi5j_KekvXpAhXkQEEAHdEpCc8Q6AEwAXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=English%20football%20and%20its%20various%20stakeholders%20were%20associated%20with%20a%20pattern%20of%20whiteness%20cleland&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">As noted by James Cleland</a></strong>, for the first 100 years of the FA (founded in 1863), “English football and its various stakeholders were associated with a pattern of whiteness”. In the UK, the mass immigration which occurred in the post-War period generated racial tensions which were aggravated through the work of racist politicians such as Enoch Powell and these tensions were regularly exploited by far-right groups at football matches.<strong> <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/10/football/racism-in-football-tammy-abraham-chris-hughton-spt-intl/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">In the 70’s and 80’s</a></strong>, some of the first black footballers in England (Cyrille Regis, George Berry, John Barnes) were frequently subjected to monkey chants and had banana skins thrown in their direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://eprints.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/4534/1/TacklingSocialMediaAbuseAM_KILVINGTON.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Kilvington and Price’s study</strong></a><a href=\"http://eprints.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/4534/1/TacklingSocialMediaAbuseAM_KILVINGTON.pdf\"> </a>describes football culture as where the “’true’ locals, a synonym for whiteness, symbolically own the game, the ground and match day experience”. To this day, around 92% of Premier League supporters are white, and although English crowds may have become less overtly racist than the 70’s, recent events prove that racism has far from disappeared. In October, a FA Cup qualifier between Haringey and Yeovil had to be abandoned after a Haringer player was racially abused, and, at a higher level, a Man City fan was charged for ‘racially aggravated public disorder’ during the Manchester Derby earlier this season. Recently the head of Kick It Out, stated that racism in football is <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/05/football/racism-in-football-kick-it-out-premier-league-spt-intl/index.html\">“worse than it was five years ago”.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Raheem Sterling is one black footballer who has had to deal with horrific racism first-hand, most notably in December, 2018 when 60-year old Colin Wing <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/media-elites-fuel-racism-british-football-181211081318914.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>shouted “f**king black c**t”</strong></a> in Sterling’s face<a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/media-elites-fuel-racism-british-football-181211081318914.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> </a>during a match between Manchester City and Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. This was not the first time Sterling has been subjected to personal, racist abuse as he was also attacked in the street by a 29-year old man, Karl Anderson, who kicked Sterling and <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/media-elites-fuel-racism-british-football-181211081318914.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>told him</strong></a> “I hope your mother and child wake up dead in the morning you n****r”. Sterling chose to speak up after the incident at Stamford Bridge, calling out the British press for “fuelling racism”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sterling has been attacked by the right-wing press regularly, with papers using demeaning language which attacks his personal life. This is often performed through headlines, on the front or back page, such as the Sun’s front page article entitled <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/sport/2018/05/disgraceful-and-borderline-racist-sun-takes-issue-raheem-sterling-yet-again\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>“Prem Rat of the Caribbean”</strong></a> which featured a picture of Sterling walking with a female friend. The use of the word ‘rat’ here creates the suggestion that Raheem is sub-human, and this is repeated by the Sun multiple times, including a 2018 article: <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/5838267/love-rat-raheem-sterling-proposes-to-long-suffering-girlfriend-paige-milian/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>“Wed Devil</strong></a>: Love rat Raheem Sterling proposes to long-suffering girlfriend”.This awful stereotype of comparing black people to animals has been perpetuated<strong> <a href=\"https://www.socialpsychology.org/pdf/jasp1995b.pdf\">from the days of slavery</a>,</strong> and is an incredibly unsubtle attempt to portray Sterling as a figure of derision for Sun readers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Papers have repeatedly tried to highlight Raheem as a ‘problem’; a player who constantly finds himself in trouble and leaves controversy in his wake. <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3037536/Raheem-Sterling-filmed-taking-hippy-crack-just-days-pictures-Liverpool-star-smoking-shisha-pipe.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>A Daily Mail article</strong></a> in 2015 criticised Sterling for ‘inhaling laughing gas’; implying this was a ‘second drugs controversy’ for the then-Liverpool player. The first ‘drugs controversy’ in this instance was Sterling being pictured smoking a shisha pipe just days earlier. Needless to say, both substances were fully legal at the time, and Sterling is far-from the first footballer to be ‘caught’ using them. The article refers to Nitrous Oxide as “hippy crack”, with the implication being that the drug is far more dangerous than it actually is. The stereotype of black people as drug users is extremely common and, here, Sterling’s so called mistakes are being highly exaggerated to fit such a label.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most egregious attack on Sterling came in 2018 when the 23-year old sported a tattoo featuring an M16 assault rifle on his leg.&nbsp; The Sun headline was, somewhat predictably, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/6397808/raheem-sterling-m16-assault-rifle-tattoo/\"><strong>“Raheem shoots himself in foot”</strong></a>, with the newspaper calling the tattoo “sick”, whilst the Daily Mail stated that <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5792513/Raheem-Sterling-escape-storm-inspiring-England-World-Cup-glory-Russia.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>“the moral majority are appalled by the inking”</strong></a>; implying all Mail readers are on the correct side of the argument. <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/9k8383/the-sun-used-the-deaths-of-two-teenagers-to-make-a-dig-at-a-footballer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>The Sun</strong></a><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/9k8383/the-sun-used-the-deaths-of-two-teenagers-to-make-a-dig-at-a-footballer\"> </a>even tried to link Sterling’s tattoo to the stabbings of two teenagers over the same weekend; the article was placed next to an image of Sterling and featured the opening sentence: “&#8221;Two more teenagers were killed over the weekend as Sterling revealed his controversial gun tattoo”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was later revealed in an Instagram post that Sterling got the tattoo as both a tribute to his dead Father, and as a reminder to himself to “never touch a gun”. This quote was itself misrepresented in the media with <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/sky-sports-apology-raheem-sterling-gun-tattoo-england-world-cup-a8376851.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Sky Sports adding the word “again”</strong></a> on the end, implying Raheem already had experience handling weapons. Such coverage certainly clearly has racist connotations, with Sterling playing the role of a stereotypically violent black male from the streets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interlinking nature of race and class is an important facet of the racial stereotyping which occurs within the media and this is especially evident with the right-wing papers’ treatment of Sterling, although this is somewhat contradictory. Several articles appear to criticise Sterling for saving money; shopping at Poundworld, Greggs or Primark, whilst others attack him as “greedy”, and note his “blinging house”, “fleet of supercars” and “astronomical salary”. The suggestion here is that Raheem does not deserve his new-found wealth, and the repeated use of words like “flash” and “bling” which are generally reserved for black men, is telling. Overall, Sterling has been subjected to an excessive level of attention on his personal life, far more negative coverage than any white players has received.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within Sterling’s Instagram post after he faced a racist attack against Chelsea, he pointed out the hypocrisy of journalists in their opposite coverage of white and black footballers.<strong> <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46498849\">A Daily Mail article</a></strong> concerning black player Tosin Adarabioyo used the headline ‘Young Manchester City footballer, 20, on £25,000 a week splashes out on mansion on market for £2.25m despite having never started a Premier League match’. Conversely, their article on white teenager Phil Foden carried the simpler headline: ‘Foden buys new £2m home for his mum’. Within the articles, the Mail implies that Adarabioyo does not deserve the house as he hasn’t earned it, whereas Foden is a good, white English lad doing his Mother a favour (Foden also hadn’t started a premier league match at the time of the article).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This contradiction is shown again in a Sun article praising England captain Harry Kane for ‘<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/6674236/harry-kane-car-collection-range-rover-jaguar-bentley/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>buying British</strong></a>’; celebrating the purchase of a Range Rover, Jaguar and Bentley. Kane, again fits the positive stereotype of someone who loves his country and, crucially to the Mail and the Sun, ‘looks English’. Sterling, despite owning a Range Rover and Bentley, as Kane does, is black and therefore no such article has been written giving Sterling credit for ‘buying British’.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ku1fBez6rLVo1wO6YGbzNCOtQ1xe8MYCYr9GyFCnMa1gIobOiTgwjveBykUq8td3KncHVUbLx5PovXfAEN29OBHZTKoQMJ6jnMnu1ZEeupwRfZAWYJDkzN1TzleOinrANa-szEMB\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The right-wing newspapers, consistently socially conservative, reject the idea of successful British black men becoming wealthy as it doesn’t fit with their narrow conception of national identity. <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yeTOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT9&amp;lpg=PT9&amp;dq=vincent+hill+the+sun+media&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sNEKcxEHfz&amp;sig=ACfU3U3LZ6Bz9VI-X8-Zy1cqtFyjYAVrZQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjgmeLTkPXpAhXViFwKHZsCDM4Q6AEwDHoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=vincent%20hill%20the%20sun%20media&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>As Vincent Hill has written</strong></a>, the Sun’s football coverage reflects “a historic yearning for a bygone authentic era when England was White, masculine, and working-class”. This can largely explain why the papers felt the need to attack Sterling’s financial decisions; Sterling is not ‘one of us’ like Harry Kane or Phil Foden and therefore cannot be a member of the ‘in-group’ to which their readers belong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although unprovable, presenting Sterling in the manner they did may have emboldened men such as Karl Anderson and Colin Wing, to conduct their awful, racist attacks on him. This is terrible but also may not even be the most damaging consequence of this antagonistic coverage of minorities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous analysis of the UK Newspapers’ treatment of ethnic minorities has reached conclusions that the press are to blame for “creating and maintaining a <strong><a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0075424207311247\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">moral panic”</a> </strong>about immigration. The editorial line of the right-wing papers is always critical of immigration, with an overall discourse of hostility towards those not deemed to be part of their ‘in-group’. The creation of such a group helps to justify the exclusionary policies which these papers are in favour of.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By consistently highlighting instances when non-whites make even minor mistakes, the newspapers can stereotype the ‘out-group’ as hostile, violent and dangerous. The attempts to portray Sterling, and black people more generally (Sterling has played the role of stereotypical black youth) as greedy, drug-using animals is part of a wider editorial strategy of ethno-populism which plays on the fears of the working-classes in order to defend anti-immigration policies. The use of fear to prime an audience is a noted tactic employed by newspaper editors, with Richardson showing how when <a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Analysing-Newspapers%3A-An-Approach-from-Critical-Richardson/2febaf4c7051929f32dd0687f141aea9ff39acf3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>“an audience is suitably fearful</strong>,</a> they will agree to all manner of questionable government policies that they wouldn’t usually”.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The events of the past week or so have made everyone think more deeply about race, and how we can all do our bit to educate ourselves and fight for a more equal and just society. Hopefully the editors of our right-wing tabloids have a long hard look at themselves as well, though I suspect that might just be wishful thinking.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Glyn Sheldon </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Link to Donation Pages/ Useful Articles:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickitout.org/donate/donate\">https://www.kickitout.org/donate/donate</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/theredcard\">https://www.justgiving.com/theredcard</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.offtheball.com/sport/what-is-with-the-british-tabloids-odious-obsession-with-raheem-sterling-147505\">https://www.offtheball.com/sport/what-is-with-the-british-tabloids-odious-obsession-with-raheem-sterling-147505</a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-wordpress wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-the-undefeated\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"HiaO2zcqnP\"><a href=\"https://theundefeated.com/features/raheem-sterling-manchester-city-chelsea-and-the-racist-media-coverage-of-black-athletes/\">Raheem Sterling, Chelsea and the racist media coverage of black athletes</a></blockquote><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Raheem Sterling, Chelsea and the racist media coverage of black athletes&#8221; &#8212; The Undefeated\" src=\"https://theundefeated.com/features/raheem-sterling-manchester-city-chelsea-and-the-racist-media-coverage-of-black-athletes/embed/#?secret=HiaO2zcqnP\" data-secret=\"HiaO2zcqnP\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/media-elites-fuel-racism-british-football-181211081318914.html\">https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/media-elites-fuel-racism-british-football-181211081318914.html</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/sport/2018/12/all-times-newspaper-coverage-raheem-sterling-helped-fuel-racism\">https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/sport/2018/12/all-times-newspaper-coverage-raheem-sterling-helped-fuel-racism</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://theconversation.com/the-suns-ethical-failings-over-the-raheem-sterling-gun-tattoo-story-97469\">http://theconversation.com/the-suns-ethical-failings-over-the-raheem-sterling-gun-tattoo-story-97469</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/glynsheldon/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b6f4eedcc4559f94dd10458b659bb94a?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Glyn Sheldon\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/glynsheldon/\">Glyn Sheldon</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

And how is theatre helping to push these conversations forward?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mental ill health has been a common theme in many plays recently such as <em>Electrolyte</em> by Wildcard Theatre, a hard hitting and honest insight into loss, friendship and mental health using music and spoken word and <em>Dust</em> by Milly Thomas, a play focused around youth suicide. But how much does it really help? I can only speak on behalf of my own experience, I am not a mental health professional, but I believe that the exploration of these topics in an artistic form helps to make experiences of mental health relatable to those affected and to those who know people who are affected. Which in turn allows people to feel like they can speak out and hopefully start open and honest conversations with their friends and family.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I founded 5asideTheatre, along with 4 other women, to use storytelling to spark conversations and break down taboos surrounding mental health. Our first show, &#8216;Side Effects&#8217;, performed in 2018 at Edinburgh Festival Fringe, commented on the pros and cons of anti-depressants. We used verbatim interviews from friends and family of different genders and ages to create this show. Putting on this play gave people a safe environment to open up in and I had friends and family members open up to me about their struggles more than they had ever done before. We went on to perform this show at a charity event with Wedlake Bell alongside mental health charity The Matthew Elvidge Trust. Our performance was followed by a Q&amp;A where we and the audience had a very honest discussion about the themes in the play and their own experiences with mental health. Our second show, &#8216;Beyond: Sugar Mice&#8217;, performed at Edinburgh Festival Fringe 2019, interrogated the psychological effects of loneliness on young people, the tender beginnings of a queer relationship against the odds, and how far we&#8217;ll go to hold onto our illusions. This show was shortlisted for the Sit Up Awards 2019, awards that seek to reward and support work that spotlights contemporary social issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mental health is something that is very personal and important to me. I have always been the support for a lot of friends and family through their struggles and theatre has helped me through my own. I was a shy and slightly awkward child who never fully felt like they fit in but when I was on stage, I was confident and would feel like I could do and be whoever I wanted. As I did more and more acting and met more and more interesting and like-minded people through acting, I became more confident in my own skin. It has really helped me through my darkest days and I have witnessed how the cathartic experience helps audience members through theirs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have worked on community led programmes using workshops to rehabilitate vulnerable people, one of the most memorable experiences was when I worked on a rehabilitation programme at Rainsbrook Secure Training Centre where I taught drama to young offenders. These programmes create a safe space for people to express themselves and allow to have an escape from their day to day lives. I could see first-hand the positive impact these workshops had on the actors and us tutors. These workshops are what inspired me to start creating my own work and how I ended up creating our first 5asideTheatre play with Giulia Hallworth, Tash Tudor, Ele Mckenzie and Zoe Aronson.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are 3 ways in which theatre has helped my mental health and the people around me:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Community</strong> – you create close bonds to the people you perform with as you have to be empathetic, communicative and sensitive to everyone&#8217;s emotions and expressions. This creates a community where everyone feels comfortable to express themselves freely.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Cathartic Experience</strong> – gives the audience members a visual aid to imagine the struggles of mental health and can allow them an escapism or an emotional release. It may also bring up themes that the audience start to question and talk about.&nbsp;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Expression</strong> – allows people to release emotions and feelings that they may otherwise keep inside them. It allows you to create characters that may have gone through similar traumas so you can explore that trauma while still distancing yourself from it.&nbsp;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Theatre is by no means the only resource to engage with this topic but creativity, imagination and self-reflection make it a great medium to create social change and an open and honest community. So whether you are a self-professed &#8216;thespian&#8217; or a first time theatre goer, give it a try as you never know what positive change may come to you and those around you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Ianthe Bathurst</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/ianthebathurst/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3d4b5a54be4c635df88f902bb651d7f1?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Ianthe Bathurst\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/ianthebathurst/\">Ianthe Bathurst</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Recent events have not only highlighted issues in the US but they’ve also unearthed the systemic racism that exists in Britain too. The support in the UK so far has been immense, but there’s no doubt that this reaction has been much needed for some time now. Whilst it’s positive to see so many white people finally acknowledging racism, it’s crucial that during the quieter times when the media buzz has died down that we are continuing to speak out and counteract racism in our day-to-day lives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst it’s easy to point fingers at America when it comes to white supremacy (that redneck, Trump supporting stereotype springs to mind), the term is not as specific as we’d like to think and can be used as more of a blanket term. In DiAngelo’s book “White Fragility”, he explains it as a “useful term to capture the all-encompassing centrality and assumed superiority of people defined and perceived as white and the practices based on this assumption” (2018). With this definition in mind, refusing to acknowledge racism as an issue or not accepting your white privilege demonstrates white supremacy in itself. There are also countless times here in the UK that white people&#8217;s voices have been considered more important than black people’s voices, even if they’re both shouting the same thing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In America, the immediate action that is needed to counteract racism is to control the police. #Defundthepolice has been circulating the internet, and for good reason, as the only way we can reduce their excessive power is if we defund and deconstruct the whole system. Orlando Patterson, head of Sociology at Harvard University <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/06/orlando-patterson-explains-why-america-cant-escape-its-racist-roots/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em><strong>said to the Harvard Gazette</strong></em></a>, “what’s needed is a complete re-thinking of police culture, and the tendency to see the communities they are serving as the enemy.” I couldn’t agree more. Not only is the system feeding white supremacy in the US, it has also now become so powerful that the department is almost acting autonomously from the state. That’s not to say that Trump is opposed to this (he’s very much an issue here too) but rather there is no control or restriction enforced on this department. Why else are we seeing countless black lives being taken and no change being instigated? America is not supposed to be a police state, so it needs to stop acting like one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst the power of the police force in the UK does not compare to that of the States, a concerning thought is that we could very well end up in the same boat. Similarly to the US, we have seen a damaging decline in youth services due to the department receiving a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/20/youth-services-suffer-70-funding-cut-in-less-than-a-decade\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em><strong>70% funding cut</strong></em></a> in the last decade. Without vital services like these which directly work to help young people from predominantly disadvantaged backgrounds stay off the streets, what’s not to say our government will not end up resulting to the police force for “help”. It is true that the British police do not receive anywhere near the amount of funding as the American police force, however, some of the principles of the American call to “defund the police” can still apply here. As in the US, our government needs to invest more money into the community to help tackle the causes of crime. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A further issue that can be identified in the UK is how widespread racism really is within society, in that it’s engrained on an implicit level. Phrases I constantly see thrown around include, “well I know I’m not racist so I don’t need to get involved”, or “obviously I’m not racist, who doesn’t support equality”, and worse, “I’m not black so it doesn’t concern me?” These same people often wouldn’t admit that they are scared when encountering a black man on the street, or that they would rather sit with the group of white people in the smoking area of a night club instead of the group of black people. It is this type of implicit racism and white fragility that I think threatens the UK the most because it’s much more slippery to tackle. If white British people won’t even acknowledge we have a race problem, how are we meant to do the vital work of anti-racism in this country?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At its core, education is key in putting a stop to this mindset. I was babysitting a 5-year-old girl not more than a year ago, and whilst playing with her toys she suddenly came out with, “do you know the black boys in my class have silly names,” I asked her what was so silly about them, and that people could say the same about her name, to which she said, “but I have a proper name.” I was shocked that at the age of 5 she was already conceptualising distinctions like this but, more importantly, this shows how young we start forming our own individual biases and beliefs. We need to drastically improve racial studies in schools because children are never too young to start learning about race, in fact the younger the better! There are petitions (via the government website) everyone should sign that are for the inclusion of Black British History in our national curriculum. You can also email local schools for a more direct approach.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst improving education is a first step in tackling institutional racism in the UK, unfortunately our overtly classist society remains a challenge yet to be tackled. Our country is run by entitled politicians who are living in a completely different world to the majority. Nonetheless, improving the education system to include Black British History is a vital first step to reduce the racial biases that people are taught to possess. Outside of this, however, a lot of white people in the UK still need to realise their own fragility, as you cannot eradicate racial bias without first acknowledging it. In terms of the Media, for the countless times I’ve had to encounter Cummings or, God forbid, Rees-Mogg, I’d like to see the same amount of black voices across the headlines until Britain starts owning up to its systemic racism. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Emily Burge</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/admin/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6732f8a705abdd596d0c587bb01459b7?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Herd Community\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/admin/\">Herd Community</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

A feeling felt by all at different degrees in various circumstances. It’s amplified by expectation on a societal and personal level. It’s associated with a sense of shame, and shame silences problems. This silence makes it hard to diagnose and therefore treat. So to speak about it further I should label it: Loneliness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Synonyms for loneliness include: isolation, abandonment, rejection, unpopularity, sadness, separation and seclusion. Seven alternate words which serve to highlight the negative nature of loneliness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In today’s society many of us communicate with our phones more than we do with other people. Together, with our phones, we peruse the internet, shop, learn languages, review our finances, listen to music and podcasts, navigate journeys, order meals for one, take photos, play games, watch movies and television programmes and write notes to ourselves. We can do this all from one spot, without a need to speak with anyone else. This is an incredible advancement in modern technology but does it isolate us? If you find yourself spending time in the presence of people entranced by their phones are you really spending time together? If you try to gain the attention of someone who is engrossed by their phone do you apologise first? If your phone is low on battery do you panic for fear you will have no escape from the silence? This is a sad reality of modern day company.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about feelings of loneliness when no one is around? Has social media become a source of companionship? Does this bid for entertainment and distraction sometimes come up short as we harshly compare our lives to the lives of others? It is easy to forget that social media allows us to advertise highly edited snippets of complicated realities, when we are feeling lonely. Social lives projected across social media can consolidate our skewed view that we are the only one feeling lonely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So why don’t we communicate our feelings of loneliness? Why is happy, excited, angry and upset so normalised and loneliness is not? Where does the shame come from? As technological advances allow us to do more activities alone and project perfect lives, is there a societal expectation to be independent and self-sufficient? Does this force us into thinking that a cure to loneliness may be found in increased status on social media or in a vice such as alcohol, drugs or sex? All of which are temporary solutions. An aesthetic bandage for a bleeding wound.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what is the cure to loneliness? First we have to change how we view loneliness. It is not defeat. It is not confirmation of our inadequacy or a trademark of rejection. Loneliness is something we all experience. Loneliness is a product of modern day society. To admit to feeling lonely is not a sign of weakness but a sign of strength, a belief that we are deserving of support. We should endeavour to identify feelings and be honest with ourselves and others. If this time of social distancing has proven anything, it is how much we need and desire human interaction. Phones allow us to contact those who are far away but we should not allow phones to consume us to the point of replacing human contact. We should not obsess over how lives are portrayed but endeavour to notice and ask how we all are behind the screens. So next time you&#8217;re in the company of others, drop it and be present.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In times of loneliness your phone or social media is not the answer. They are the pull, slip, trip, dive, fall further into loneliness. Human interaction is the answer. We are the answer to each other&#8217;s loneliness.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Orla Friel</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/orlafriel/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1db4841359148e7d67b14cb28bdf9c98?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Orla Friel\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/orlafriel/\">Orla Friel</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Indeed, it remains apparent that many believe Britain holds no place in the racial issues that plague the U.S., a common misconception that leads to a weaker understanding of modern societal issues. This is largely due to a lack of education concerning the morbid realties of the British Empire, and the oppression it imposed. It strikes me that, as a history graduate, I have been taught very little surrounding the impact of British colonialism and, when it is actually discussed, solely the positives seep through.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all too familiar phrase ‘the sun never set on the British Empire’ only serves to feed the illusions of grandeur and wealth regarding Britain’s imperial expansion and masks the brutal existence of this late institution. The reality is that Britain exercised a much more villainous role over the territories it colonised, and the lack of understanding regarding this only reinforces British denial.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, it seems British reluctance to engage in the discourse encricling their responsibility for racial injustice, particularly in America, is somewhat shocking, especially when evaluating their role in the slave trade. It may, in fact, come as a surprise that Britain effectively kickstarted the endorsement of slavery. Certainly, Britain was the starting point from which the slave trade continued, and although the empire did not directly utilise slave labour, they unquestionably benefitted from its produce. Likewise, the introduction of sugar, tobacco and cotton plantations in both America and the Caribbean was undeniably the result of British interests. Indeed, it has been estimated that Britain transported 3.1 million slaves, only 2.7 of which actually survived. Due to Britain’s selfish desire to increase their economic gain, the slave trade and slave-holding societies such as North America continued to thrive and so did the suffering of millions of innocent Black lives. Subsequently, it remains obvious that Britain must be held accountable for the repercussions of the slavery it effectively started, and can no longer hide behind the idealistic view of British imperial ‘success’. Only in 1807, two hundred years after this horrific enterprise began, did Britain abolish this trade, at best under the scrutiny of those promoting new enlightened ideals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Equally, another indubitably significant example of the extent of the imperialistic trauma Britain engaged in is that of the widely unknown ‘Boer War’. Between 1900 and 1902, the United Kingdom attempted to reinforce their dominance over South Africa, a nation desperately fighting to gain independence from the empire. Among the atrocities committed by Britain throughout this war was in fact the implementation of the first concentration camps. The unquestionable fact that Britain imposed such horrendous death camps, only just under 100 years after they abolished slavery, is despicable. As is the rejection of British blame. This war was intended to be hidden from the greater public as evidenced by the extensive letters of Lord Milner, the individual tasked with managing these camps. This obvious denial and rejection of Britain and evident inability to convey the actualities of British imperialism provides further confirmation of the need to cover this period in greater depth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, British imperialism did not solely affect the minds of those it condemned but infiltrated the beliefs of many Britons themselves. British literary icon and avid imperial supporter, Rudyard Kipling, further enforced deep-rooted racist prejudices in the everyday lives of his peers. Astonishingly, even Kipling’s children’s books and illustrations were littered with unquestionably racist references to the ‘savages’ Britain saved through colonisation in Africa and excused treacherous behaviours through the ‘liberalisation’ of different races. Similarly, the author’s arguably most ‘famous’ or, perhaps more suitably, ‘infamous’ piece, ‘The White Man’s burden’, inexcusably urges the condemnation of other races through encouraging America to annex and colonise the Philippines. Kipling’s work sits amongst a plethora of undeniably racist writings and authors and is only indicative of Britain’s role in bringing about contemporary racial issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, these are but a few brief examples which in no way cover the extent to which British imperial power affected those it entrapped. However, they are a start to gaining a greater comprehension of the U.K’s role in contemporary societal and systemic racism both in American and Britain itself. The fact that Britain effectively created and certainly endorsed modern chattel slavery but rejects any responsibility for the contemporary racial conflicts in America is due to a lack of knowledge and clearly further more education is needed. The British justification was always that of ‘educating savages’ and ‘enlightening the uncultured’, which in actuality is no justification at all but an insult to those the empire unmistakably affected. Only through understanding the British role in racial history and its modern repercussions can we better acknowledge our modern issues. Indeed, just as the sun never set on the British Empire, it should not set on the issues it created.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Ella Walker</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"has-text-align-left\"><strong>Below are some useful articles and books to better educate yourself on Britain’s colonial history and its role in our modern societal problems:&nbsp;</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h6>“Spin on Boer Atrocities” – Paul Harris</h6>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/dec/09/paulharris.theobserver\">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/dec/09/paulharris.theobserver</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h6>The Truth About British Colonialism – Mathilda Marcus&nbsp;</h6>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/12/read-all-about-the-truth-about-british-colonialism\">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/12/read-all-about-the-truth-about-british-colonialism</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h6>Racism is rife in Modern Britain:&nbsp;</h6>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/black-history-month-racism-institutional-britain-slavery-education-employment-culture-colonialism-a9170841.html\">https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/black-history-month-racism-institutional-britain-slavery-education-employment-culture-colonialism-a9170841.html</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h6>How to be an Ally: Starter pack&nbsp;</h6>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bUJrgX8vspyy7YttiEC2vD0DawrpPYiZs94V0ov7qZQ/htmlview\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bUJrgX8vspyy7YttiEC2vD0DawrpPYiZs94V0ov7qZQ/htmlview</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h6>Sign the Petition to Better educate British children about the Empire:&nbsp;</h6>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/gavin-williamson-mp-teach-british-children-about-the-realities-of-british-imperialism-and-colonialism?recruiter=859640556&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_abi&amp;utm_term=psf_combo_share_initial&amp;recruited_by_id=5e625190-1ab3-11e8-b6f9-cf929c778edd&amp;utm_content=fht-22521696-en-gb%3Av12\">https://www.change.org/p/gavin-williamson-mp-teach-british-children-about-the-realities-of-british-imperialism-and-colonialism?recruiter=859640556&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_abi&amp;utm_term=psf_combo_share_initial&amp;recruited_by_id=5e625190-1ab3-11e8-b6f9-cf929c778edd&amp;utm_content=fht-22521696-en-gb%3Av12</a></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/ellawalker/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cdc07f08f57016bbe6de1218a5cdad37?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Ella Walker\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/ellawalker/\">Ella Walker</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Like the last stragglers emerging from a party in the early hours of the morning, we’re all trying to remember what the hell happened last night, or last week, month, or maybe even this very afternoon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Withnail and I’ directed by Bruce Robinson came into the world rather quietly in 1987 with a limited release in cinemas. Late night screenings and word of mouth meant the film later came into prominence as a cult classic. After a brief resurgence post Brexit vote, the film is oddly prescient during these times of isolation. Here are some reminders of the film’s iconic scenes and quotes, within the context of lockdown.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>1. The Washing Up&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>There are things in there, there’s a teabag growing</em>”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Withnail and I’ begins in Withnail and Marwood’s flat in Camden, at the arse-end of the sixties. The unemployed, constantly pissed actors have seemingly forgotten their domestic duties – their kitchen looks akin to an exploded crockery factory. Faced with what seemed like an unknown apocalypse, your flat may have resembled this chaos at some point. Lockdown began with an ideal of domestic harmony. This semblance of order slowly washed away, like the dregs of a mouldy cup of tea. You reach a point when you can’t take it anymore. “Right you fucker, I’m going to do the washing up!” you scream at an unfortunate flatmate who happens to be in the room. They deplore you to reconsider, as fervently as Paul McGann tackles Richard E. Grant in the opening minutes of the film. “There are things in there, there’s a teabag growing”, he screams, “don’t attempt anything without the gloves!”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>2. The Plant Obsession&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>I happen to think the cauliflower more beautiful than the rose</em>”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Withnail and Marwood pay a visit to the former’s rich Uncle Monty (played by the fantastic Richard Griffiths), to try and nab a week in his country house, to escape their London flat and move their habits to a more rural setting. On entering the house Marwood discovers with slight panic that Uncle Monty is a few steps past eccentric. His luxurious living room is decorated with cauliflower and cress growing from antiques. With the kitchen being a forgotten cause, you have delved into the plant department, to sustain any sense of a wholesome household. Your room becomes almost as bizarre as Uncle Monty’s. You adorn it liberally with whatever plants you manage to get your hands on in Sainsbury’s. Yet, no matter how hard you try, they seem to want to survive even less than your sourdough starter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>3. Going Outside&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>I think we’ve been here too long, I feel unusual, I think we should go outside</em>”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once a day you forsake your flat for the wonders of ‘nature’ and a spot of government-sanctioned exercise. Similar to Withnail and Marwood’s foray into the countryside, your walk is never as harmonious or as green as planned. Leaving the house and playing socially distanced human dodgems is becoming less appealing by the day. Yet the alternative of staying inside leaves you feeling ‘unusual’. You start to question what day it is, what time it is, and is there really any time anymore? Withnail and Marwood give up fresh air and instead down gin at their local, the Mother Black Cap &#8211; an appealing idea for you but unfortunately not an option (although hats off if you’ve managed to find a take-away pint). Instead, you pound the pavements once more, avoiding direct eye contact, and listen to yet another podcast.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>4.&nbsp; The Drinking</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I must have some booze, I demand to have some booze!</em>”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a desperate point in the film, Withnail resorts to drinking lighter fluid after he dramatically declares “I must have some booze!” to no avail. The end of the day brings you to similar sentiments, though hopefully not lighter fluid. It’s 6pm, another day has come to a close and the urge to shift half a bottle of wine is growing stronger by the minute. Is a bottle of Echo Falls deemed an essential enough item? You give in, and nip to the off-licence, masked and gloved. The shop owner and you are now on a first name basis, and you emerge into the evening light, triumphant if not a little guilty with a bottle in hand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>5. The Politics&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>Shat on by the Tories, shovelled up by Labour”</em>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current political stakes are just a little more urgent than the delivery of this line in the film, declared by Uncle Monty; glass of ’53 Margaux in hand, sitting in his country house. The phrase had a brief renaissance for some post Brexit and is quite the zeitgeist for the lockdown period. The word Durham is enough to remind us all that the country’s lockdown efforts have been spectacularly ‘shat on’ in the last few days, if not before. Let’s hope Keir Starmer possesses a very large shovel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>By Annabel Wood</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/annabelwood/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a32e29fb355d6dce461b11d30b5013c1?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Annabel Wood\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/annabelwood/\">Annabel Wood</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

George Floyd was killed after policeman Derek Chauvin of the Minneapolis Police department put his knee on George’s neck for nine minutes. As he did so, George cried out that he could not breathe, which echoed the last words of Eric Garner who was murdered by police in 2014. The video of George’s death justifiably led to widespread and worldwide protest, both violent and non-violent. Far from the first time that an innocent black man has been murdered, it also won’t be the last, unless we implement some drastic changes to the policing system and wider reform is brought about amongst the whole of society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/RfySbIZ4mkAEJ-hbmzeD7VIMt0rMLp-AiY7knLkJccD6TJmV838k7mArC4IemZMSRvZDwLwWtckcI0R728dtE17f-k6zjKk-Svdro6MlQWyPoGKbqtw7k1V2kXAQHI43n800iSqj\" style=\"width: 800px;\"></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>LA Johnson/NPR</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst it may be easy to comment on the disgusting treatment black people face in America, we should be incredibly wary of ignoring the situation closer to home.

Their important stories are regularly ignored by mainstream media, but we need to remember them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incredibly, despite claims from some that the British police are so much better than their American counterparts, since 1990 there have been <a href=\"https://qz.com/1117185/ipcc-report-in-the-uk-every-prosecution-over-a-death-in-police-custody-in-the-past-15-years-ended-with-acquittal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><em>over 1500 deaths</em></strong></a> in police custody in England and Wales. And we have to <em><strong><a href=\"https://novaramedia.com/2020/06/01/george-floyd-is-now-a-household-name-in-britain-why-isnt-jimmy-mubenga/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">go back to 1969</a> </strong></em>to find the last time a police officer was convicted for the death of a detainee.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The names of some of the victims of police violence in America are now well-known by many: Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, George Floyd. In the UK, the assumption that racism is neither systemic or widespread has meant that the murders of innocent black people have often got swept under the rug. Yet there are hundreds of horrifying incidents of the avoidable killings of BAME people, and miscarriages of justice that have occurred in recent years. Here are just a few of the names and stories that people should know. This is by no means an exhaustive list:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Stephen Lawrence</strong>:</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1993, Lawrence was stabbed to death in an unprovoked, racist attack by a group of white youths as he waited at a bus stop with his friend. Originally, <a href=\"https://www.stephenlawrence.org.uk/\">“five suspects were arrested but not convicted”</a>, although two of the five were eventually convicted in 2012. Four years on from the initial trial, there was a public inquiry led by Sir William MacPherson which concluded that the Metropolitan Police was “institutionally racist”. This should have been a landmark moment which led to severe changes in the running of the police and justice system. Sadly, despite this, there have still been many similar occurrences since Lawrence’s murder.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Sean Rigg:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sean was a British musician and producer with mental health problems. He died in 2008 from cardiac arrest at Brixton police station in south London.  After being arrested for public disorder, assaulting a police officer and theft of a passport (which was his own), he was leant on for eight minutes when arrested, in a horrifically similar manner to George Floyd. He was placed face down with his legs bent behind him in the van to the police station, by which point he was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19049173\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><em>&#8220;not fully conscious&#8221;</em></strong></a>. He was then left handcuffed for 10 minutes in the &#8220;rear stack&#8221; position, and found dead 35 minutes later. In 2016, the CPS announced that there was not enough evidence to charge the officers, let alone convict. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/01/sean-rigg-five-officers-cleared-of-misconduct-over-death-in-custody\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><em>Marcia Rigg, his sister, said</em></strong></a>: &#8220;My family is surprised and bitterly disappointed by today’s announcement. We categorically do not accept this decision, which only serves as further upset and anguish. We regard the evidence as compelling and strongly believe that a jury should have been given the opportunity to make a decision on the evidence. The public&#8217;s confidence in the British criminal justice system is tarnished by decisions like this.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Jimmy Mubenga:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2010, whilst on a BA deportation flight, Mubenga, already being handcuffed to his seat, was restrained by three G4S guards. <em><strong><a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/shine-a-light/jimmy-mubenga-and-shame-of-british-airways/\">One guard, “had his knee pressed against the deportee for about ten minutes”.</a></strong></em> The flight’s captain joked that Mubenga was <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://novaramedia.com/2020/06/01/george-floyd-is-now-a-household-name-in-britain-why-isnt-jimmy-mubenga/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>“faking it” </em></strong></a>and might have attended drama school. He died after “fellow passengers said they heard Mubenga cry out: “I can’t breathe” as he was pinned down in his seat”. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/16/g4s-guards-found-not-guilty-manslaughter-jimmy-mubenga\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>The three guards were cleared of manslaughter.</em></strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Mark Duggan:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011, Mark was shot and killed by police as they attempted to arrest him. He was found to be in possession of a pistol and the killing was deemed lawful. However, the inquest determined that he did possess the weapon when he turned to face police, meaning he was not reaching for the gun when he was shot. The pistol was <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/27/mark-duggan-gun-five-metres\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>found in bushes</em></strong></a>, 5m away from Duggan’s body and none of the witness reports mentioned anyone seeing Duggan discard the weapon at any point during the shooting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police in the UK are permitted to shoot if the person in question is deemed a real and imminent threat. Given Duggan was not reaching for a gun, and he was &#8216;assumed&#8217; to be a real threat by the acting police officers, this undoubtedly brings into question the unconscious racial bias of the officers. Would the outcome have been the same if the man in question was white? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was also some disgusting press coverage of Duggan following the shooting, with the media cropping images of him to make him look more <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eleanorkpenny/status/1268116169439039489\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><em>&#8220;thuggish&#8221;</em></strong></a>, as well as ignoring repeated calls by his family for an independent inquiry. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Sarah Reed:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah was attacked and assaulted in 2012 in police custody. CCTV showed police grabbing her by the hair and punching her, resulting in two broken ribs. PC James Kiddie, the officer who assaulted her, was given a community service order and sacked from the force. The police were aware she suffered from mental health issues brought on by the death of her baby daughter in 2003. Sarah sadly committed suicide in 2016 whilst in Holloway women’s prison.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A jury found castigated the prison staff and mental health professionals for some serious and horrifying failures – including not following MoJ procedure – which contributed to her death. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/17/sarah-reeds-mother-deaths-in-custody-holloway-prison-mental-health\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><em>“Sarah’s death was entirely avoidable. She would be alive now if the governor, prison staff, psychiatrists and mental health in-house team had simply done their jobs in a timely and professional manner.&#8221;</em></strong></a> </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Julian Cole:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2013, Julian was tackled outside of a nightclub by police officers after a scuffle with the doormen. They broke his neck and gave him severe brain damage. He is now paralysed and still suffers with the damage to his brain that they caused. In 2018, <em><strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/22/julian-cole-police-officers-face-dismissal-over-incident-in-which-student-was-paralysed\" target=\"_blank\">three of the six</a></strong></em> police officers that were involved were sacked for lying in relation to his arrest. They lied in statements about his condition during the arrest and were found guilty of gross misconduct. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-45940066\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Their names are PCs</em></strong></a> Nicholas Oates, Sanjeev Kalyan and Hannah Ross. Julian&#8217;s mother, Claudia Cole, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-45940066\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>spoke after the tribunal</em></strong></a>: &#8220;This tribunal decision makes it clear that not only did the officers lie about the event involving Julian, they showed an inhuman indifference to his welfare.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Edson da Costa:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Police in London stopped Edson and two friends in a ‘random’ traffic stop in 2015. After the situation escalated, the police used <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.officer.com/training-careers/article/12072303/training-the-distraction-strike\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>&#8220;distraction blows&#8221;</em></strong></a>, a technique used to subdue a person with extreme and sudden force to get them to submit to arrest. During this time, Da Costa attempted to swallow some bags of heroin and crack, before losing consciousness whilst handcuffed. Edson later died in hospital due to a lack of oxygen in the brain, as a result of a blocked airway. There was no evidence of excessive force being used against him, however it was found afterwards  the ambulance was given the wrong address. Although the inquest heard that this didn&#8217;t make a difference, the police were accused of being slow to react to Edson choking on the bags. <em><strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/edson-da-costa-death-inquest-police-restraint-drugs-black-men-a8948366.html\" target=\"_blank\">Edson&#8217;s father accused the police of acting incompetently</a></strong></em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/edson-da-costa-death-inquest-police-restraint-drugs-black-men-a8948366.html\" target=\"_blank\">,</a> stating: “We cannot help but wonder whether Edir would still be here had the police identified the risk of Edir choking earlier and taken steps to help him.” </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Sheku Bayoh:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sheku Bayoh died in police custody in East Fife, Scotland after being restrained by officers in 2015. He was 31 years old at the time, and had taken MDMA and a drug called flakka, and his body was found to have 23 separate injuries. Despite this, and the Prosecution team having CCTV footage of Bayoh being restrained, no charges were filed against the officers involved. <strong><em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/16/sheku-bayoh-brother-shouldnt-have-died-like-this-inquiry-family\" target=\"_blank\">His family called it a &#8220;betrayal of justice.</a> </em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The officers involved have denied any wrongdoing and it was <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-52754957\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>only announced</em></strong></a> last month that there will be an inquiry into what happened. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Rashan Charles: </strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/shine-a-light/rashan-charles-police-restraint-death-iopc/\" target=\"_blank\">In 2017, Rashan was followed</a></em></strong> into a shop where police claimed he was trying to swallow a packet, later found to be containing paracetamol and caffeine. Whilst being chased and restrained by a police officer, Charles tragically died shortly. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2017/sep/03/rashan-charles-death-cctv-footage-shows-moment-of-arrest-video\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>The footage</em></strong></a> of his arrest and restraint went viral on social media, leading to multiple protests. A 2018 inquest found that he died as a result of the package obstructing his airway, and that the use of force by police officers was justified. It was also concluded however that the officers failed to follow correct protocol as they did not call for an ambulance soon enough. The officers involved were given the right to anonymity. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Annabella Landsberg:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017, Annabella, 45, a diabetic, refused to take her medication and was restrained by four police officers. She was then left on the concrete floor of her prison cell, lying in her own urine for 21 hours with only one member of staff checking on her by throwing a cup of water on her and receiving no reaction. They didn&#8217;t give her any medicine and she wasn&#8217;t seen to eat or drink any of the food and water that was left for her, and the staff reported that Landsberg was <strong><em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/22/prison-deaths-annabella-landsberg-diabetic-hmp-peterborough\" target=\"_blank\">“seeking attention and faking medical issues”.</a></em></strong> She was then rushed to hospital where she died three days later. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was recorded as dying from natural causes, despite the prison and probation ombudsman (PPO) calling the events leading to it <em><strong>“<a href=\"https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ppo-prod-storage-1g9rkhjhkjmgw/uploads/2019/04/N137-17-Annabella-Landsberg%C2%AD_HMP-Peterborough-1-1.pdf\">truly shocking</a>”</strong></em>. The PPO said staff took far too long to carry out clinical observations that “might have been able to prevent her death”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her sister, Sandra Landsberg, said: “They failed their job as professionals. The treatment she got was awful. No one deserves treatment like that. In the end, my sister had to lose a life. Her kids don’t have a mother now. That’s very traumatising.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Nuno Cardoso:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>25-year-old Nuno Cardoso was an Oxford law student who was arrested on suspicion of possession of a knife. He was apprehended before being struck by a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-48907116\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>police baton</em></strong></a> during his arrest. He died in custody. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cardoso had mental health problems including anxiety and PTSD and during the hearing over his death his Mother said <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-48907116\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em><strong>he had told her</strong></em></a> he would “become the best lawyer in the country”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The inquest heard that the police used &#8220;reasonable and proportionate force&#8221; when making the arrest, with the post-mortem blaming alcohol, cocaine and morphine for his death as opposed to him being aggressively restrained and hit with a baton.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-48926632\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>PC Charles Smith</em></strong></a> stated in his defence that &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve been up to hospital with people who&#8217;ve feigned illness as a precaution,&#8221; whilst <strong><em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-48926632\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PC Kate Young</a></em></strong>, who was also meant to help Cardoso, claimed she initially thought he was &#8220;playing [up] based on my previous experience of other detained people&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nuno was the fifth black man to die after being restrained by police officers in 2017.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Shukri Abdi:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, 12 year old Shukri was pushed into a river in Bury as a group of five children watched on and laughed. The girl drowned after struggling for several minutes. She was also found to have had injuries that suggested she had been abused before her death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/26/other-child-laughed-as-shukri-abdi-drowned-in-river-inquest-told\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>The Guardian wrote</em></strong></a>: &#8220;A child who tried to save the life of a drowning 12-year-old Somali refugee has told an inquest that another child who took her to the river laughed for two minutes while she died”. One of the children apparently told Shukri: &#8216;If you don’t get into the water, I’m going to kill you.&#8217; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The children involved have faced no punishment for Abdi’s murder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://gal-dem.com/the-death-of-shukri-abdi-she-was-failed-when-she-was-alive-and-shes-still-being-failed-now/\" target=\"_blank\">Bashar Ibrahim, a human rights activist, said</a></em></strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://gal-dem.com/the-death-of-shukri-abdi-she-was-failed-when-she-was-alive-and-shes-still-being-failed-now/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>:</em></strong></a> “This young girl was failed when she was alive and she’s still being failed now she’s dead”. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Belly Mujinga:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Belly worked at Victoria Train Station, where she was spat at by a member of the public who claimed to be infected with COVID-19. She later died from the disease on April 5th, 2020 . Police concluded that her death was not linked to the attack, and in May announced that no further action would be taken.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/vgHCs3zXpJROIYFNJZPF6doCrdv84gn6LqiMNm8MHSPxWMPM0UiTqMHU4I-O9p9KcsJVJMw22RkGKEsJc-uIJYqOT07YByeQlrXMba7JPmDbjy6uM0YyCEuv7gnBh3AYMecQPFnX\" alt=\"\" width=\"597\" height=\"893\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>All these deaths of BAME people in the UK were avoidable and all of them should have, at the very least, resulted in justice being provided to the perpetrators. We can’t ignore the cases of these people in our own country, we can’t let them go unnoticed. If we assume that the problem is distant, that they don’t affect us, then things will never change. The problem is right here and it’s going to take all of us fighting together to prevent further innocent lives being taken.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the murder of George Floyd, there is an opportunity that his death will not be for nothing. The incredible coverage of the murder, protests and police violence has given many some hope that there can be some progress that arises out of tragedy. This will only occur if people take the time to educate themselves about the experiences of black people in the UK, call out racism directly and give both their time and money to political and social causes which aim to root out racism from society. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Glyn Sheldon</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Many thanks to James Allen who compiled a vast amount of research for this article. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong>IMPORTANT</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>There is a list below of some useful links for campaigns/films/articles/petitions/donation pages:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPFLqk1Nhdw\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPFLqk1Nhdw</a> (Guardian film about Julian Cole)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/mayor-jacob-frey-justice-for-george-floyd\">https://www.change.org/p/mayor-jacob-frey-justice-for-george-floyd</a> (Petition for George Floyd)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.justiceforbigfloyd.com/\">https://www.justiceforbigfloyd.com/</a> (Petition for George Floyd)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://minnesotafreedomfund.org/donate\">https://minnesotafreedomfund.org/donate</a> (Donate to Minnesota Freedom Fund)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ms_blm_homepage_2019\">https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ms_blm_homepage_2019</a> (Donate to Black Lives Matter)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://secure.givelively.org/donate/the-bail-project\">https://secure.givelively.org/donate/the-bail-project</a> (Donate to The Bail Project)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.joincampaignzero.org/#vision\">https://www.joincampaignzero.org/#vision</a> (Campaign Zero to end Police Violence in the USA)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nlg.org/donate/\">https://www.nlg.org/donate/</a> (Donate to National Lawyers’ Guild)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/defundthepolice/\">https://blacklivesmatter.com/defundthepolice/</a> (BLM Defund the Police)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.stephenlawrence.org.uk/support-us/donate/\">https://www.stephenlawrence.org.uk/support-us/donate/</a> (Donate to Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://unicornriot.ninja/donate/\">https://unicornriot.ninja/donate/</a> (Union Riot)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://tribunemag.co.uk/2020/05/its-time-for-international-solidarity-with-minneapolis\">https://tribunemag.co.uk/2020/05/its-time-for-international-solidarity-with-minneapolis</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/05/29/865261916/a-decade-of-watching-black-people-die\">https://www.npr.org/2020/05/29/865261916/a-decade-of-watching-black-people-die</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.blackvisionsmn.org/\">https://www.blackvisionsmn.org/</a> (Black Vision Collective)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.runnymedetrust.org/uploads/Race%20and%20Policing%20v5.pdf\">https://www.runnymedetrust.org/uploads/Race%20and%20Policing%20v5.pdf</a> (Runneymede Trust Report on Racist Policing in the UK)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/theredcard\">https://www.justgiving.com/theredcard</a> (Donate to Show Racism the Red Card)</p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/glynsheldon/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b6f4eedcc4559f94dd10458b659bb94a?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Glyn Sheldon\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/glynsheldon/\">Glyn Sheldon</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

But we need to remind ourselves that by isolating and helping those in need, we really are doing our part. We all know the importance of supporting local and independent businesses through this time and like many industries our contribution is necessary for years to come. This includes the world of print publications, who have been heavily hit by the current climate. Most of us have a little bit more time on our hands and would love the company of a nice glossy magazine or newspaper, so don’t forget to pencil them onto your weekly shopping list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been a vicious circle of unfortunate events for print publications, as they are dependent on a series of events that need to take place in order to get the publication from print into our homes. Covid-19 has managed to ruin every link of this chain; from the printers to the distributors, the shops to the public footfall required to purchase these copies. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dependency on footfall for publication sales is a contributing factor to their decline, especially for the likes of the Evening Standard who relies on commuters picking up the free copy from tube stations across London. The newspaper has cut distribution to 500,000 copies, tried a home delivery service for ES magazine and furloughed many staff.&nbsp; But life would never quite be the same if we no longer got handed a copy of the publication on our way home from work. We can help prevent this by continuing to read the E-Edition online. Many other newspapers are also beginning to push their readers to the tablet and smart phone editions, which is hugely preferable to the publisher.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-instagram aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-KnHUzlNFQ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

An unprecedented global event calls for new ways of working and living so we are pivoting into home delivery for your ES Magazine. Beginning next week,  ES Magazine will be delivered by door drop for the first time in the  magazine’s history, directly to your houses in 26 neighbourhoods  in zones 2 and 3. From Hampstead to Bethnal Green, Brixton to  Hammersmith, Swiss Cottage to Greenwich, hundreds of thousands  of households will now have their ES Magazine delivered to their door. Our role is to be consistent in informing and entertaining you as we all settle into the new normal that is a more isolated life, so you will also find copies of the magazine in thousands of supermarkets across the capital, including Sainsbury’s, Waitrose and Tesco, as you head out for your essential trips. We are your London magazine and in the face of crisis and isolation we will be doing everything in our power to unite the capital.&#39; @laura_weir</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/eveningstandardmagazine/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> ES Magazine</a> (@eveningstandardmagazine) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-03-25T17:56:52+00:00\">Mar 25, 2020 at 10:56am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote><script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum are the glossy magazines that provide us with the ultimate inspiration and escapism.&nbsp;Whether you pick one up in the supermarket or take up the ease of home subscription delivery, there is no excuse for abandoning your favourite monthly magazines. Now is the best time to subscribe and read those magazines cover to cover. Those of you who are less old school and would prefer to read digitally then online issues can be downloaded as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many publications have announced digital issues in response to the current climate. British Vogue’s May &amp; June issue, Another Man’s Summer/Autumn 2020 issue and Dazed’s spring/summer 2020 issue are a few that are now free to download digitally for the first time ever. Dazed Editor-in-Chief, Isabella Burley announced the choice is a ‘gift to all of our readers who are facing a whole new king of present in the wake of this crisis.’&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t want to see the end of your favourite newspaper or magazine then make sure to support them during this time and pick up a copy. They are sure to brighten your day and provide some at-home entertainment during this continued period of isolation. The World Health organisation have also confirmed that newspapers and print publications remain safe to read during this time and ‘the risk of contracting COVID-19 through receipt of a printed paper is infinitely small.’ So now there really are no excuses!</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Annabel Rodick </em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/annabelrodick/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6d9addfa1f255d42b5aa03d2a17d8dc0?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Annabel Rodick\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/annabelrodick/\">Annabel Rodick</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

The parks are full, the roads are wonderfully jammed, and you can even buy yourself a pint albeit in a plastic beer pong contraption. It’s not in writing yet, but lockdown is over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, moving on from lockdown will be like handing down your favourite garments to your juvenile and ratty infant cousins. You know you’ve outgrown the grey GAP-emblazoned monstrosity, but you wonder how you will survive without it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can we come to terms with the crushing reality that this lockdown life of tranquillity and bliss is over? Yes, we bent the rules from time to time (going to the shops for that essential bag of twiglets) so it wasn’t quite house arrest. And yes, there were also a few downsides.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we’ve become accustomed to the lockdown, and now that we’ve seen the light, it’s hard to go back to murky realities of, well, reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, in a bid to mourn our loss and move on, perhaps we could try to do things a bit differently going forward. Before sliding back into normality, perhaps it would be worth pinning down the best aspects of lockdown. Then let us take the learnings from this moment of penetrating foresight with us, as we bumble buoyantly into the new dawn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Britain BC, the social status quo had always been alcohol. Probably in a pint glass and probably in a pub. Pre-Coronarites would rat-race furiously all hours of the working week, so that they could recline cozily with their companions in refuge of their local boozer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without this institution of British social convention to fall back on, the nation has been forced to get quite creative over the past few months. Whether you’ve started a cooking channel, organised a virtual concert or turned your child into the Amazon monster, this period of forced creativity has been mesmerising. Long may this continue.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image2.jpeg?resize=640%2C640&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1370\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image2.jpeg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image2.jpeg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image2.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image2.jpeg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image2.jpeg?resize=500%2C500&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the government-imposed sofa slump, we’ve slowed down and had time to reflect. According to research, reading time has doubled under lockdown. Book worms have feasted on classic novels about comforting, approachable themes such as isolation, contagion and pandemic love triangles. Read Gabriel García Márquez&#8217;s<em> Love in the Time of Cholera</em> if you want a slug of all three.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lockdowners have also taken a keen interest in the news, primarily to discover the legality of pausing on a park bench. In fact, global news consumption has increased by 36% as lumbering politicians teleport themselves into our living rooms with one uniting purpose: to remind us what a suit looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the most encouraging aspects of the Great Lockdown have been environmental. We discovered the vaccine for climate change! Well not really, but the ozone layer has been given a much-needed break. This pandemic will result in the biggest drop of carbon emissions on record.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to this slowdown, a viable solution to the environmental crisis seems to have been presented. We can continue this downward trend. As long as the BBC does not see this progress as a chance to follow the popular craze of bashing the over-70s, by furloughing David Attenborough.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we’ve read more, engaged with the news a little bit more and consumed less fossil fuels. Well done us. What’s more we’ve ditched the commute, caught up on current affairs (well, Netflix) and we’ve actually taken the time to speak to our distant family and friends. With the loss of the pub, we’ve been forced to be more creative with our time and money. And with a tasty recession up next on the menu, that creativity might just come in handy.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Caspar Barnes</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/casparbarnes/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/451c66e4edc94eef5ca562047168c717?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Caspar Barnes\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/casparbarnes/\">Caspar Barnes</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

I work in the care industry as an agency carer, and part of my job involves visiting many different care homes and hospices and interacting with a large selection of individuals. Individuals primarily consisting of women. During my time working with these incredible ladies, who go to work daily and selflessly care for vulnerable people, I realised that I kept having the same conversation. The conversation sometimes came up multiple times a day and involved every women in the vicinity at the time, and was always about the same subject: their appearance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have listened to women tell me about their children, how they love and adore them, how proud they are, and then within the same conversation they look at their own body with disgust and distain because they are not what toxic gossip magazines would consider beautiful. And yet I look at these women, and I see selfless and kind people that have created life inside of them, something that for some women would be a miracle. I do not see the disgust they feel, I see love and kindness, but only given to others and not for themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talking about weight in a negative way may seem harmless if we are talking about ourselves, but imagine sitting next to a friend that was half the size that you are, and they look down at their stomach and say ‘I look disgusting, I need to lose weight’. How would this make you feel being twice the size? Would you think that they might think of you as disgusting? This sort of comment, although the negative aspect is directed at the self, can be incredibly damaging to the friend sat next you. The way we talk about our own bodies has power over others even when we may not even realise, and surprisingly it can go the other way as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we can establish negative comments directed at the individual, or yourself are damaging, that’s a bit of a no brainer, but what about positive comments? Is it okay to comment on someones weight if we are going to say something positive? A lot of people, and myself included once upon a time would have agreed that it’s a compliment or an ego boost, but my experience over the last few years has really shown me that this is not the case. Of course we all deserve to be given compliments and should be able to feel amazing and be happy, but ultimately when we comment on someones weight, we are commenting on a physical aspect of that person that has an unachievable beauty standard for all except celebrities (who lets remind ourselves have the time and money to have surgery, personal trainers, personal shoppers and hair and make up artists).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The typical question ‘you look great have you lost weight?’ appears at face value to be a compliment, however by commenting this way, we are subconsciously indicating to that person that they are seen more when they are thinner. Fast forward two weeks and this individual has put the weight they lost back on, is most likely internally hacking at their self esteem and is replaying all of the ‘positive’ comments that were said when they had lost the weight. These comments stay in the mind subconsciously and enforce damaging thinking habits towards ourselves and can make people feel worse when they revert back to previous weights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being small and society’s idea of attractive will not make you happy or successful and we really need to stop glamourising having a small waist. It saddens me when I see women denying themselves of food or a type of clothing because of their weight, you deserve what makes you happy regardless of what size you are. And if I am being totally honest, I am tired of listening to people talk about my weight when I am not even included in the conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is it acceptable to discuss someones weight? I remember being at work one day and listening to 3 women openly discussing my body, I was not included in this conversation, but because the women considered what they were saying as compliments they deemed it acceptable. Most people probably wouldn’t think that when they say to someone how nice it must be to be skinny, or how they wish they were there size, it can again be damaging. Last year I wanted to die. I did not want to be on this planet anymore, I was dealing with 20 years of unprocessed trauma and a complete lack of self esteem. It was the hardest period of my entire life, I stopped eating and lost a concerning amount of weight. Comments praising the size I am creates toxic thoughts whereby I think it is better to be smaller, that I am more accepted this way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I urge you next time you go to comment on someones weight, even if you are doing so in what you think is a positive or complimentary way, just don’t. We all have our issues with our bodies, and we all need to recognise that these issues come from external influence. These thoughts come from years of imaging and language we see and read in media and advertising, they are designed to make you feel that way about your body. We must also acknowledge that when these toxic or negative thoughts are reinforced by a comment made by a friend or a work colleague it can be really quite damaging.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we were all truly happy with who we are and the way we look, then capitalism would not work. Advertising works solely on the principle of ‘you need this product to be a better you’ or ‘you need this product to live the best life’ and convinces us that we are not good enough just as ourselves. So when someone wishes they looked like me it frustrates and upsets me, not only because I am battling the war of negativity in my own mind, but because people don’t understand that I am this size because I was mentally very ill and am now in the process of recovering. Being this small is not healthy, and it is not something that is achievable in a healthy way. Let me repeat that:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Being this small is not healthy, and it is not something that is achievable in a healthy way.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also won’t make you happy. I was the smallest size I had ever been and I felt the worst I ever had in my entire life. The correlation isn’t there, skinny does not equal happy so stop torturing yourself and glamourising something that is not naturally achievable. Behind the face of ‘beauty’ there is so much pain and suffering, inflicted on ourselves by ourselves because of subliminal messaging we receive from external sources, or as some might call the patriarchy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Popular culture encourages the idea that in order to be happy and successful you must be attractive, and in order to be attractive you must adhere to society’s ‘standard’ that we see constantly in media. When over the course of our lifetimes we are subject to this imagery of ‘attractive and successful’ people, it is natural for our brains to assume that is what we must achieve to be happy and seen as successful in the eyes of society.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I regularly day dream of a world where women realise that we are more than what we look like. I imagine a world where all the hours and money that women spend on their appearance, was spent on personal growth and achieving their true goals in life. Imagine how many more women in places of power we would see.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In todays social climate we are bombarded with advertisements and images containing a narrative that is meant to subconsciously warp our perception of what we are and what we should be. Materialism has led us down a pathway that reinforces the belief that in order to be happy (and each persons definition of happy should be their own) we must be beautiful and successful. Capitalism is the system that creates the belief that we can achieve happiness through being more beautiful or owning more stuff. That we are not good enough unless we have perfect skin, luscious hair and are a size 8 and have the newest trends. Being bombarded with a beauty standard that isn’t even achievable for models without airbrushing or surgery is toxic, and we women need to recognise this. We have allowed a society to manifest that holds a persons entire existence based on their appearance, when we are all so much more than that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So next time you have that feeling of not being enough, or dislike to towards your body, just remember that even if you did achieve that perfect body, you will still not find that feeling of inner peace and happiness. There will always be something we can find in ourselves that we do not like, we must all learn that those negative feelings are a product of the conditioning we have been exposed to for our entire lives. Appearance and materialism will not fill the empty feeling inside, that comes from accepting who you are, and loving yourself despite your flaws because you deserve that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As human beings we seem to love destroying ourselves. We now live in a world where almost half of children have mental health issues, low self esteem is rife, consumerism is the main drive of society and we continue on these self destructive pathways that we seem unable to stop repeating. Perhaps this all stems from the same root cause, that we are made to feel inadequate in some way by eyes of society from a young age. Be this by expectations from parents, the media, our education system &#8211; who knows, but what I do know is we must all recognise that feeling in ourselves and understand that we are allowed to exist on this planet as our most authentic selves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Amy Junnonen</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/amyjunnonen/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7078fd0016bf6e0d0989b91e9284cf2c?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Amy Junnonen\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/amyjunnonen/\">Amy Junnonen</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

I have experienced moments of feeling threatened, followed, uncomfortable, oppressed, in both public and private spheres. However, from a young age, I have been taught that if ever I was to come into trouble, I just have to call the police and by virtue of my gender and the colour of my skin, they will be there to serve and protect me. Not everyone has this privilege.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a white person found themselves in a situation where the police were called, but knew they were innocent, they can have absolute confidence that their innocence will not be questioned. If a BAME individual was part of an incident where the police were called, even in the knowledge of being totally innocent, there is no certainty that they wouldn’t be perceived as guilty until proven otherwise. Most kids get ‘the talk’ about sex. BAME children also receive ‘the talk’ on how to act when approached by the police so as not to aggravate or provoke a further issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reports that have emerged from America in the last week are not ‘shocking’ or ‘hard to believe’, they are a harrowing reminder of the fact that we are living in a systemically racist society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>George Floyd begged for oxygen; he was denied the only thing that is truly free in this world. George Floyd was murdered, actually crushed by white supremacy. Kneeling on someone’s neck, slowly squeezing the air out of their lungs is a genuine form of torture. George Floyd knew that he was going to be killed. How can an individual be so derailed from any sense of humanity that he can tell a man to ‘relax’ in response to George Floyd crying ‘they’re going to kill me’?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Derek Chauvin, the police officer who murdered George Floyd, along with the others who stood by him are in no way excusable, but they are acting in the way that their fractured, oppressive society has deemed as acceptable. The patriarchal society that we are all living under has allowed white police officers to believe it is their right, and in many ways their duty, to react to and treat BAME individuals in this manner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The onlookers who recorded George Floyd’s murder are as much complicit in the overbearing oppression of white patriarchy as the officers themselves. They did not do anything to forcibly save George Floyd. They attempted to plea for the officers to let George Floyd breathe but they did not overthrow the officers. This is due to the effects of white patriarchy harming every identity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While they are clearly fearing for George Floyd’s survival, they are also too fearful of their own fate to intervene. They have no way of knowing that the officers would not also brutally force them to the ground. The very people who are put in place to protect them, inflict fear in them. It is this dominant power of the police that stopped people from acting and led to another black life being viscously stolen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christian Cooper asked Amy Cooper to put her dog on a lead as it would disturb the birds that he was out watching in Central Park. As she reported his ‘threatening’ remarks to the police, Christian Cooper was not just a man in the park, he was an ‘African American’ man. Amy Cooper knew the weight that came with naming his skin colour and in doing so she planted a warrant on his head. The dramatisation and panic in her voice is purely to get a reaction from the police, while Christian remains calm and in no way threatening at all. In fact, Amy is the one threatening Christian.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any report to the police, the recognition of skin colour is perhaps the most bigoted thing a person could do, as if it was more of a threat because Christian has black skin. Would Amy have said ‘there is a white man threatening me’? I doubt it. Would she have even reported it at all if Christian was white? Or was the issue largely rooted from Amy’s internalised racism and subsequent anger at being told she couldn’t do something by a black man?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amy knew that through highlighting Christian’s skin colour, her report would induce a greater sense of urgency in the police’s reaction. Who knows, if the police had found Christian in the park, he could’ve been treated with the same brutality and faced the same murder as George Floyd. Simply because a white woman recognised the power that she has purely from being born white.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People of colour do not have the privilege of this protection and its time white people recognised that. Amy Cooper attempted to capitalise off of her white privilege. Calling the police is a last resort, people deserve to feel safe, but for the right reasons. White people have weaponised calling the police, as Amy cooper did, using it as a threat is a violent act in itself and this needs to be stopped. If Christian had reported that a white woman was threatening him, it would have held next to none of the same gravity as Amy’s claims. Amy Cooper’s police call was a death wish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Atatiana Jefferson, shot in her own home by a police officer while playing video games with her nephew, the eight-year-old boy witnessed his aunts murder. Breonna Taylor, shot eight times as police officers attempted a narcotics search, on the wrong house. These people were hunted and there are so many more. White people need to stop using the police as a defence mechanism. The police are just as much of a weapon as the weapon that all police officers seem to assume BAME individuals carry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not that racism is becoming more of a problem, it is that awareness of racism is rising because it is being filmed. Technology and social media are both a blessing and a curse in this sense. Although it is important to show that mistreatment and violence occur every day, white people should not have to watch and share something to recognise that this is happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The indignity of an innocent murder is hard enough to comprehend. What is more undignified is that even with hard evidence of discrimination and murder, of actual footage of a human taking their last breath, ‘FBI investigations’ and court cases still occur. Chauvin has been previously investigated for three other shootings, one fatal, and yet he is still a valued, and protected, member of the force.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no doubt that those people were murdered, yet somehow the system allows for the perpetrators to attempt some kind of defence because they are police officers. Do you think if a black man knelt on white police officers’ neck until he was starved of oxygen and died that he would be given a fair hearing in court?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>White people need to hold ourselves accountable for the actions of our community. It is not enough to share a video on a group chat and say, ‘how horrific’ or ‘can’t believe this’. Firstly, you cannot know how triggering witnessing a violent act can be to someone. Secondly, it allows for a fleeting moment of horror that is ‘unbelievable’ to be watched and then left. It is even less helpful to make throw away comments such as ‘lucky we don’t live in America’. Racism engulfs us in the U.K too and being unable, or unwilling, to recognise that is one of the largest faults in our society today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>White people need to educate each other. Conversation and discussion educate people and this topic needs to be spoken about now more than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speak to your friends, family, colleagues. Call them out when they say something out of turn. Challenge them. It will be uncomfortable but not as uncomfortable as ignorance. Not as uncomfortable as living with loss. Not as uncomfortable as having a genuine fear of the police, a system that is put in place to protect everyone. If you remain silent, you remain complicit within your oppression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you stop ignoring that something is happening, it stops being hard to believe. Once you register that discrimination and inequality occur every single day through a prejudice hatred, it stops being so shocking. It is a white person’s duty to acknowledge their privilege and as Angela Davis said, recognise that “it is not enough to be not racist, you must be actively anti-racist”. Being anti-racist is not a radical act, it should be how everyone defines themselves as that is what equality is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The necessity for white people to recognise the power that their voice holds, in equal measure of if you use it or not, is vital. To use it, in the right way, is to tackle systemic racism. To stay silent is to allow systemic racism to remain a stagnant status quo of society. With police brutality on BAME people being repeatedly reported, white people’s active participation in the dismantling of systemic racism is necessary and it is necessary now. Our silence is our complicity.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Phoebe Rayner</em></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/phoeberayner/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3a73634c3e96e1d165eabad0e4411306?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Phoebe Rayner\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/phoeberayner/\">Phoebe Rayner</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Since the Coronavirus outbreak there has been no UK horse racing of any description. Sad times. However, to quench my thirst for risk and profits my attention has turned to something that I would argue is all the more unpredictable and risky: the stock market. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to coronavirus, all of the main markets tumbled drastically in mid-March but have since made strong recoveries. Personally I feel the stock market is currently very overvalued with the real effects of Coronavirus (e.g. record levels of unemployment) not yet felt due to Government furlough and bailout packages. Technology companies have been at the epicentre of the markets fightback with Coronavirus heavily accelerating the use of technology in our everyday lives. Whether that be Netflix, Video Games or Zoom. Many foresee that the working landscape may completely change with the classic office work environment becoming a thing of the past, particularly as firms try to reduce their costs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Cars and Energy</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>I am going to focus on the car industry and energy sectors and discuss how we could be set to see massive changes in these sectors with one&nbsp; technology company in particular uniquely placed to capitalise on this global predicament. My belief that is we are looking at a ‘stock of a generation’, a future Amazon or Apple currently available before it has grown to global superpower. The stock I am discussing is Tesla.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla is best known for its production of electric vehicles, but it also a big player in solar power and&nbsp; batteries. If you google Tesla, you may read that it is significantly over-valued as a car manufacturer, however this isn’t a true reflection of Tesla. Tesla is a technology/ energy company and must be valued as such. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I will start by discussing Tesla’s position in the electronic vehicle market. The most obvious&nbsp; feature of Tesla cars is that its electric, meaning it produces no fossil fuels and is eco friendly. Tesla initially struggled to capitalise on this key selling point since its cost of manufacturing was so high (particularly battery costs), coupled with high research and development expenses. This meant it was unable to turn a profit and could only get close to breakeven by charging high prices, making their product inaccessible to the majority of consumers. Additionally, there was long charge times for relatively short journeys. Naturally, this didn&#8217;t instil confidence in potential users who had concern they could would be unable get from A to B without needing a re-charge for up to 12 hours. This resulted in many people betting against Tesla and shorting Tesla stock. Nowadays however, Tesla has successfully turned a profit for the past 3 quarters and has industry leading profit margins. I will illustrate how this has come about below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Characteristics</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>To form the basis of my arguments I will focus on Tesla’s standard Model 3. The range is 350 Miles per charge, charging from zero to full in 40 minutes and charges at 127 kilowatts per hour (kWh), which works out at £13 per charge. This Model 3 now sells brand new for £40,000. The car has a lifespan of 300k-500k hours (roughly 25-35 years). Furthermore, despite being an electric car, the Model 3’s acceleration is very fast, clocking 0-60 mph in 3.2 seconds. This makes it&nbsp;roughly the same speed as a Ferrari 458. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To demonstrate the ability for acceleration of electric cars, the Tesla Roadster (sports car) does 0-60mph in 1.9 seconds which makes it the quickest car in the world. The inside of Tesla has all the electronic specifications one would expect; a simple smart screen dash board alongside its stylish and comfortable interior. Tesla also has an impressive autopilot technology which allows it to steer, accelerate and brake in its lane. This is all the more impressive when you consider Tesla’s strongest marketable credential is that it is eco friendly. Unlike previous models, a 350 mile drive&nbsp;and 40 minute charge-time make these cars a very workable option for people in their everyday lives. A Tesla car will cost you less to fill up than its petrol counterpart and will last you much longer, roughly 30 years. Due to&nbsp;constantly improving technology, Tesla has forecast that these numbers will continue to improve rapidly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>The Elon Musk effect</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO, has announced that in June Tesla will launch it’s ‘battery day’ which he has been quoted as saying “will blow your mind. It blows my mind”. Musk is no doubt the genius driving force behind Tesla, much like Steve Jobs for Apple or Jeff Bezos for Amazon (although I will concede I wouldn’t ask him for advice naming a child, as his new-born son has been named X Æ A-12 Musk!) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Musk, who rose to prominence through the pioneering of Paypal, is a man who is not easily impressed. One of his other companies Space X, produces reusable rockets. These rockets can launch into space and then land back on earth at an exact spot. Worth a watch on Youtube if you haven’t seen before. Pretty impressive! Hence when he announces a “battery day which will blow his mind” one is expecting something pretty good. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conservative estimates say the new battery could produce a total mileage capacity of around 650 miles by the of the year, with a charge time of 25 minutes. This is coupled with a doubling of the total battery life to one million hours. This means the possibility of a Tesla  lasting you a driving lifetime of 60-70 years. The cost of recharging will also come down meaning you could charge it for as little as £10 per charge. Tesla has been setup so its software, hardware and production are all done in house, with no outsourcing. This means it is at no risk from outside supply shocks as well as being able to keep all of their technology developments internal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, as Tesla’s technology advances many of its supply costs are falling. The battery powering the car is by far the most expensive component, yet Tesla’s battery costs have been dropping by 15% a year, so in 4 years these costs will have halved with no sign of these developments stopping. Due to Tesla’s eco friendly credentials they often have access to certain governments grants, as has been demonstrated in China and also in Texas or Nevada where there is&nbsp; potential for new Tesla gigafactories. As Tesla continue to grow, these cost savings are being passed onto consumers thus resulting in their cars rapidly becoming cheaper for the consumer. In conclusion, comparing Tesla’s electric car business model compared to that of a petrol counterpart is pretty clear cut. <em>To put it simply: It’s cheaper to run, faster, lasts longer and is better for the environment.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Covid-19</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>If it wasn&#8217;t clear enough already, the Covid-19 pandemic has only compounded the shift away from ‘Big auto’ (Big car manufactures e.g. Ford, General Motors etc). Big manufacturers have been hit hard by coronavirus as no one is buying/selling cars at the minute and the majority of factories have ground to a halt, forcing more vulnerable organisations to take out huge loans to stay afloat. For examples, General Motors was forced into taking a $16Bn dollar loan from the Federal Bank. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar sort of financing activates have been seen across big auto. Often the first cuts made by ‘big auto’ are the heavily expensive research and development based electric vehicle programs which produced little to no profit.&nbsp;Electronic vehicle&nbsp;programs for ‘big auto’ are at the stage where Tesla was a few years ago. Very high running costs with little or no profit hence their reasoning behind these cuts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla, on the other hand, has a war chest of about 7 billion pounds in cash so Musk has decided to vamp up production and expansion during this coronavirus period. Expansion plans are proceeding at full speed with new gigafactories being completed in China and another one currently being built in Berlin, with discussions for a new factory in the USA underway. Similarly, in Q1 Tesla actually delivered record car sales in part due to their sales mechanism being largely online thus resulting in a smaller reduction in their car sales due to coronavirus compared to ‘big auto’. Tesla currently stands several years ahead of all its competitors in the in electronic vehicle sector whilst none of the traditional auto makers have the technology or financing to compete with them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Musk has also stated big plans for the development of Tesla’s&nbsp;full self driving cars with the aim of competing with the likes of uber in the not too distant future. The only conceivable threat would most likely come from other technology companies, Google for instance, but even for tech giants it is not an easy industry to break into. James Dyson, who recently topped the Times UK rich list with wealth of £16.2bn, claimed to have made a car to rival Tesla’s. Yet even with his considerable resources and intelligence decided not to take the product forward to market as he couldn’t commercialise the product because it was too expensive to manufacture. The failed&nbsp;project cost him £500m.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>The Future</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The electronic vehicle industry is only the start for Tesla, mainly as their battery technology has countless further uses. 10-20 years ago, production via renewable energy such as wind and solar was not seen as a viable solution to provide enough electricity for the world. Nowadays, due to development in battery technology the energy conservation process is much more efficient making these renewable energy resources a realistic eco-solution for the provision of electricity to the masses. As a result, renewable energy resources are ready to break out in coming years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla acquired Solar City in 2016 and has since poured lots of revenues from Tesla into this company. Armed with the new battery technology from ‘battery day’ which I mentioned above, Tesla and it’s subsidiary ‘Solar City’ is ready to crack the market. In retail, they have solar panels and power walls which anyone can purchase and install. However, Tesla&#8217;s main arena for massive expansion is commercial. Nowadays, new commercial power plants are choosing renewable energy sources instead of fossil fuels since they&#8217;ve become significantly cheaper to setup and run, and they are more eco-friendly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla’s battery storage software is not solely limited to solar. Bear in mind that Elon Musk is also the CEO of extremely promising companies such as Space X and the Boring Company which have large potential upside for Tesla. These companies specialise in space travel and cutting edge tunnelling technology. Part of Musk’s genius is we are already beginning to see these businesses start to benefit from one another. Just 2 weeks ago, the building of a new tunnel was completed in Las Vegas by Musk’s ‘The Boring Company’. The aim of this tunnel was to greatly reduce pollution and congestion in the city, and in particular, cut travel time to the airports. I believe in the future we will see many cities move to this type of tunnelling infrastructure in order to reduce congestion and pollution in big cities. Crucially these new forms of express transport will only work with electric cars. This means in cities were these projects come into effect Tesla is going to be the vehicle of choice. Whilst the project is not yet complete in Vegas, they have already proposed projects in the pipeline in Chicago, LA and Washington.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Block37Station.jpg?resize=589%2C332&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1340\" width=\"589\" height=\"332\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Block37Station.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Block37Station.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Block37Station.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><em><strong>The above shows the proposed station at Chicago airport which will run an express service to downtown Chicago</strong></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To conclude, I believe Tesla is well on it’s way to being the next Apple/ Amazon of this generation. The shift to electric cars was inevitable but the current coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the process further increasing Tesla’s unassailable lead over it competitors. Tesla’s battery storage technology will be also be at the centre of the further shift to renewable energy in years to come with their improvements in technology making it more efficient, more cost effective and environmentally friendly compared to their fossil fuel counterparts. After years of betting against Tesla, the financial markets and money from big institutions is finally starting to flow into Tesla stock, as illustrated by Tesla’s strong stock bounce back from the lows of March (the penny is dropping). With Tesla’s ‘battery day’ only weeks away its stock price could easily move above $1000 from $815 (at the time of writing) in the very near future. I foresee this trend continuing in the coming years with the share price moving into the multi thousands in the next decade. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This should not interpreted as financial advice, and should only be interpreted as educational </em></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Will Benjamin</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/willbenjamin/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/03269a257d93ba8e67424cc21549159b?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Will Benjamin\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/willbenjamin/\">Will Benjamin</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

It is, therefore, of the utmost importance that we find coping mechanisms to help us through hard times, and also to reach out to others who are suffering – we can simply do this by offering an ear or sharing with others our own methods of staying sane. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having battled with my own mental health since my former teenage years, and having experienced an untimely bereavement, it is surprising that these days I am the happiest I’ve ever been. I see beauty in things I did not before, I see light and love in abundance, I see kindness, and above all I SEE right now. The present moment. The here and now. After all, this is all we have. It is so easy to get hung up on the past, or dwell on the future. But all of this is irrelevant. The past has already happened and is unchangeable. The future may not happen. All we tangibly have in this world is this current moment right now. The moment after you’ve experienced something, or noticed your experience, is the moment that it ceases to exist. Being present in the current moment is one of life’s gems. In the here and now, there are no past mistakes to haunt us, or worries of what the future holds. There is only this current experience of existence. When we realise this, we can be free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My new found joy for life or happiness let’s say, is mainly a result of three important practises in my daily life; Discipline, Ritual, and Mindfulness. Encompassed within these are the practices of meditation and yoga – my saving graces.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong>Discipline</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>You might hear people rave about this and think it’s nonsense, but trust me, <em>discipline sets you free</em>. Discipline comes in many forms, but for me it is about showing up daily to my Yoga Mat, sitting down for 10-20 minutes a day to meditate, and a freezing cold shower in the morning. If I was feeling down before these practices, I won’t be by the time I’m finished with them. In my journey with mental health, Yoga was the first thing I came across that made a difference to me. I would say this this is where it all changed. There is something about Yoga, and If you’ve done it before, you’ll know what I mean. It is an incredibly special, and also –&nbsp; if practiced traditionally – spiritual practice. A place to truly connect and <em>be </em>with the self, a moving meditation, and a space in which you can observe your thoughts and bodily sensations, (hopefully) non-judgementally. The latter comes with time and practice. Yoga has numerous psychological and physiological benefits, and – I believe – something for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong>Rituals</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>These should be little things that make you feel good and bring you joy. It can also be lovely to make your rituals a multi-sensory experience. For example, a favourite ritual of mine is bathing. I indulge my senses with candles, essential oils and bath salts. Involve some mood lighting to create a soothing environment, and if you’re into it, get a crystal in there with you too (see crystals and bathing guidelines first though). As humans, it feels good to indulge our senses. Try adding smells to your rituals for a little boost. Another ritual I swear by is journaling. Journaling is a platform upon which you can express your inner-most feelings in a totally non-judgemental place. This can be an incredibly cathartic release. Written therapy, if you will. Sometimes I find myself caught up on something, and after a journaling session, it seems trivial. What I’m trying to say is writing something down can be the equivalent of ‘getting it off your chest’ verbally. Try it next time something is on your mind. It could be the release you need. If, like me, you’re into the sensory experience thing, light a stick of Palo Santo or a candle, for some good vibes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong>Mindfulness</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The above rituals and disciplines involve perhaps the most important practice; mindfulness. Now, this is an incredibly powerful tool. If you don’t know how to practice mindfulness, try a guided meditation course. I recommend Headspace’s ‘Basics’ course or Sam Harris’ ‘Waking Up’ course. Adding mindfulness to your daily routine allows one to become more aware of the inner workings of the mind. After continual practice, you will be able to detach from that critical little voice inside your head, and simply observe it. Bliss, right?&nbsp; Be patient though, this takes time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you’re going through a rough time mentally, or even if you’re not, try adding a little discipline, ritual and mindfulness to your day and see what happens. You might never look back.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If you’re interested in seeing content about yoga for mental health and other yoga-related stuff, please check out my Instagram page <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/isayogini/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>@isayogini</strong></a> where I share my journey.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Isabella Whitaker </em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/isabellawhitaker/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1a5abbeb3a8d407bf74d9ac35ca634ac?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Isabella Whitaker\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/isabellawhitaker/\">Isabella Whitaker</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Revelations of this apparent transgression led to swathes of the public spewing their sanctimonious bile out into the Twittersphere and many, including Conservative MP Steve Baker, demanded Cummings’ resignation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Curiously, a common point of contention seemed to be, as Beth Rigby bullishly and indignantly reminded us all, that thousands of others have made painful sacrifices in their adherence to the letter of the lockdown, with some even having to forgo saying goodbye to their elderly and dying parents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with this sort of argument is that it makes a comparison between two very different circumstances but treats them as though they were identical. The key difference between Cummings’ actions and a final visit to a relative on death’s door lies in the likelihood of spreading the virus.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Cummings’ account is to be believed, it is hard to see how driving without stopping to a private home and then isolating within it for a period of time, and then returning to London after having received medical clearance jeopardises the lives of others in any way. Visiting a relative dying of coronavirus however poses the obvious problem of subjecting the visitor to a risk of catching the virus, which they then might spread to others. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Debate over whether Cummings did indeed contravene the spirit of the lockdown that he himself had supported led some, and only after much public pontification, to the conclusion that there is one rule for the powerful and another for everyone else. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The irony here is that this is the very thing that those who called for Cummings’ resignation were implicitly advocating. If politicians and their special advisors were treated exactly the same as the public, Cummings would be fined for any flouting of the rules, not sacked. But perhaps we ought to hold those in power to higher moral standards, which after the disingenuous indigence amongst the press and public, shouldn’t be all too difficult to achieve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My suspicion is that much of the outrage directed towards Cummings did not stem from his actions, but rather is the product of his critics stumbling across a ready pretext in which to express their resentment of him. For those who despise the Conservative government, or for those who hold Cummings culpable for the country’s supporting of Brexit, this recent imbroglio serves as the perfect excuse to let loose on him. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is worrying about this, however, is that it reveals a failing of moral integrity. Exaggerating or even feigning outrage at Cummings’ behaviour suggests a malleability of one’s ethical standards that is not be applauded. We should not bend our moral principles to suit our political allegiances.  But this is precisely what has happened. Many who have bemoaned Cummings’ actions will have not batted an eye lid at Labour MP Stephen Kinnock’s driving hundreds of miles to visit his aged parents, or indeed at Labour MP Tahir Ali’s attending of a funeral in his constituency as one of 100 attendees. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Political partisan is not a justification for the inconsistent application of moral standards. We either believe there are reasonable grounds for a slight flex in our adherence to the lockdown, or we do not. We cannot have it both ways. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Isaac Parry </em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/isaacparry/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dadf9e84eecbbcddcefe0b50cc7520ff?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Isaac Parry\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/isaacparry/\">Isaac Parry</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

It is an amalgamation of the words ‘iPod’ and ‘broadcast’. He also suggested the terms ‘audioblogging’ and ‘guerillamedia’ but I think it&#8217;s fair to say the rightful winner stuck. My love of podcasts has only grown during lockdown and I’d like to share a few that have been keeping me company on my daily stroll. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4>1. <strong>Angela Scanlon’s Thanks a Million</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you love listening to the sweet dulcet tones of an Irish accent as much as I do then this one&#8217;s for you. Interviewees include Aisling Bea, Sian Clifford and even the Ice Man, Wim Hof himself. Each episode delves into what the subject is grateful for, ranging from birdwatching to breathing, from dating apps to dancing. A cheery reminder of how the simple things in life can bring us the most joy.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-instagram aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAFGDlWH4Ty/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

This week it’s the turn of @iceman_hof &#8211; he is a force of nature. At the beginning of the year I did an ice bath with @thenaturallifestylist &amp; 99 other humans &amp; I was obsessed. I’ve since been doing cold showers every day. It has totally changed how I feel &amp; is an instant mood reset. This isn’t about physical pain or discomfort it’s about finding strength within &amp; honestly getting out of the frosty ass shower makes you feel invincible. If that’s not your bag, listening to this will also give you a lift. You can feel his energy all the way from the Netherlands!! PS @oprah is also a fan xx anyone else doing showers??? I know it’s a Kundalini thing too x If you’re in Ireland follow @breathewithniall he does courses regularly &amp; is Wim Hof trained 🧊 #wimhofmethod #wimhof</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/angelascanlon/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> ANGELA SCANLON</a> (@angelascanlon) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-05-12T07:34:35+00:00\">May 12, 2020 at 12:34am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote><script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4>2. <strong>Banged Up</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Interviewed by a prison lawyer, two ex-prisoners tell all about their experience of life inside, broaching subjects of drugs, violence, relationships and boredom.

March 2019 there were 62 prisoners released ‘in error’ I.e they were wrongly discharged from prison or court when they should have remained in custody, where the prisoner has not deliberately played a part in the error. Examples include misplaced warrants for imprisonment or recall, recall notices not acted upon, sentence miscalculation or discharging the wrong person on escort 🤦🏻‍♀️</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bangeduppodcast/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Banged Up</a> (@bangeduppodcast) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-05-15T11:06:47+00:00\">May 15, 2020 at 4:06am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote><script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4>3. <strong>Whole Truth</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Jordan Stephens is pathing the way to de-stigmatise talking about mental health.

Businesses from the village hairdressers, to multinational airlines, to fast-food restaurants are struggling right now, and are in dire need of some financial assistance from the Government. The British Government should, of course, do all it can to keep these businesses afloat- the effects of not doing so would be disastrous for the country- job losses aplenty or a potentially more dangerous problem of businesses sending workers into unsafe conditions. However, if companies want to receive help from the government, they should at least meet some very lenient standards to ensure that a) they are able to be sustainable for the future, and b) they contribute fairly to the well-being of society.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2008, the financial crash rocked the banking industry to near-collapse. RBS and Lloyds TSB (via Halifax, Bank of Scotland) had to be bailed out by the Government to the tune of £500 billion. Unfortunately, when the bailout package was given, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/nov/05/rbs-climate-change-rights-abuses\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>nothing fundamentally changed</em></strong></a> that would either prevent something similar happening again, or that would make the banking giants play a more beneficial role for the country at large. There was an opportunity to punish RBS specifically, for the <strong><em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2073467/RBS-bailout-The-arrogance-greed-sheer-stupidity-punish-UK-households-years.htm\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;arrogance, greed and sheer stupidity&#8221;</a></em></strong> that led to their massive losses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The banks at the time were, perhaps rightly, considered ‘too big to fail’- the amount of money the public held within them was so great that letting them go bust would have been disastrous. You could therefore have expected the Government to look out for the wellbeing of the British citizens to ensure that no bank could be ‘too big to fail’ in the future. Banks could have been ‘<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/the-guardian-view-on-banks-break-up-big-finance-and-kick-the-watchdogs-too\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><em>broken up</em></strong></a>’ and regulations tightened to increase security against future crashes. Sadly, no such condition was applied to the bailout money.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;This time round, such a package should come with some strings attached&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Now in 2020, with another economic crisis upon us, there is again a necessity for the Government to step in and support businesses who would otherwise fail. This time round, such a package should come with some strings attached. We now have even the most devout capitalists at the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7836c4ce-893e-11ea-a01c-a28a3e3fbd33\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Financial Times</em></strong></a> calling for such measures: for corporations listed in tax havens to be exempt from receiving Government money. This policy has been introduced in <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/coronavirus-denmark-bailout-tax-haven-companies-uk-richard-branson-a9475081.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Poland</em></strong>, <em><strong>Denmark</strong></em></a> and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c6bf2a72-e2c0-43cc-94af-35e998bf81fa\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>France</em></strong></a> already, as well as recently being supported by the Labour government<strong><em> <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/wales-wont-give-coronavirus-bailout-22022841\" target=\"_blank\">in</a></em></strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/wales-wont-give-coronavirus-bailout-22022841\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em> Wales</em></strong></a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a company doesn’t want to conform to the, already ridiculously easy rules of paying just 19% corporation tax on their profits (less than the basic rate of income tax), then why should you be eligible to receive funding which, after all, will come out of the pockets of the taxpayers. A corporation which reaps the benefits of workers and consumers within the UK, whose health, education, infrastructure and transport are funded by taxes from the UK, has a responsibility to give something back. And if you can’t meet those basic standards- and want to instead use your team of accountants, and your residency in Monaco, Panama, or Luxembourg to &#8216;technically&#8217; not be subject to <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/offshore-tax-havens-how-do-work-what-done-change-paradise-papers-panama-bermuda-caymans-turks-caicos-a8039916.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><em>UK tax law</em></strong></a>, then why should our government give you money when you can’t survive on your own two feet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/xthsU9Bmu3emiYxayKOPzwLXeNQ4VI_NJk4-WOjA4WMHCa0nIiqCg2p1bjztrGtTDN5RzI0Jy8MD-CzRM7hBoyeC3Tf2PHL5T3HZA1PocnbvmmTLL1FJKeT3sz4xACqkRtSYaKwT\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Ordinary citizens who had to bear the brunt of the effects of 10 years of brutal austerity, with wage freezes and cuts to essential public services, were constantly told they should’ve saved up during the good times. If they couldn’t hack these tough economic conditions, then tough luck, because in a society based on neoliberal capitalism, you’re on your own. Well that should surely apply to businesses too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is <strong><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRlndgfIpb4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">currently estimated</a> </em></strong>that about £5.3 trillion of the world’s wealth is stored in tax havens, with this costing world Governments roughly £700 billion/year. This money could obviously be a huge boost to governments wishing to invest in the health, and general quality of life of their citizens but instead, simply goes to making those who are already extremely wealthy, even richer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;It might even make them think twice about their actions in the future&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, in the future, it could and should be possible to severely limit the amount of taxable income lost to tax havens. Either by creating an international formula whereby countries around the globe agree to tax multinational companies <strong><em><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/offshore-tax-havens-how-do-work-what-done-change-paradise-papers-panama-bermuda-caymans-turks-caicos-a8039916.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">“based on their sales, investments and employee numbers in various countries”,</a></em></strong> or through simply unilaterally taxing companies’ revenues instead of simply their stated profits. However, in the meantime, it could send a huge message to these companies that wish to flout taxes, if our Government decided that they were&nbsp; not eligible for taxpayer-provided funding during a crisis. It might even make them think twice about their actions in the future. It’s a low bar, but pressure will still need to put on Boris and Sunak to do anything that would penalise their <em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/14/new-chancellor-rishi-sunak-challenged-over-hedge-fund-past\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">wealthy friends</a></strong></em> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2015/apr/01/tory-100-industry-captains-party-donors-tax-avoiders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><em>Conservative party donors</em></strong></a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A very welcome but surprising update has just come from the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52719997\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><em>Treasury who have announced</em></strong></a> that companies receiving Government funds during the Coronavirus crisis will be banned from paying bonuses and dividends. This is a great start, and is certainly deserving of praise. However, there is still a lot more that the Government can do in this unique position they find themselves in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/z3_S9ro0E-yuQY3iexiItw3hXOKWvx-wQehvvXfy84CnbmCfG4E3sew23HRdWCoPkEXMvGWuOQztbGl1HNhYqEiUypv1bqszltaKjzUoQBmuFba7GcWAtqcMTF5Pby4YobY-lXK_\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2020/03/22/if-uk-companies-want-a-bailout-there-must-be-conditions-attached-these-are-my-suggestions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><em>Other strings</em></strong></a> which could be attached to Coronavirus bailout packages could include environmental standards. For businesses such as airlines, and car manufacturers who are seriously struggling due to lockdown, now is the perfect opportunity for the Government to use their increased leverage to apply tough regulations on carbon output. This could be done through setting a target for net-zero emissions or mandating these companies spend a proportion of their profits on green technology. As we come out of one crisis, we will soon be facing another one on the horizon, and such a policy should be brought in whilst companies (who otherwise have no economic interest in curbing their carbon footprint) are desperate for government funding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as this, the Government could apply rules which would benefit the workers of these companies. They could make it so that companies wishing to receive grants or loans would have to pay their workers a real living wage, allow workers to unionise and actually end the gender pay gap (which somehow still exists despite the Equal Pay Act being passed in 1970).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, there is a lot that could be done whilst the power is in the hands of the state. Adding these strings to the bailout which these wealthy and powerful companies are calling for would give some real tangible benefits to millions of people who are struggling. And looking forward, it would force corporations to reconsider some of the worst aspects of their business models, and allow our country to be better off in the future. Other countries have taken the lead on this but there is no reason why we can’t follow the good example set by Denmark, Poland, Wales and others. Will Boris and Sunak do it? Probably not. But if/when they don’t, they should be held to account for costing our taxpayers and caving to corporate demands at the expense of workers, the environment and equality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Glyn Sheldon </em></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong>Useful Links</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>For some further information on tax havens, and the 2008 bailouts as well as the current state of state-provided support for businesses, check out some of these pieces:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7836c4ce-893e-11ea-a01c-a28a3e3fbd33\">https://www.ft.com/content/7836c4ce-893e-11ea-a01c-a28a3e3fbd33</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/tax-havens-theres-a-chance-now-to-apply-conditions-to-bail-outs-137303\">https://theconversation.com/tax-havens-theres-a-chance-now-to-apply-conditions-to-bail-outs-137303</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/27/clergy-tax-haven-coronavirus-richard-branson\">https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/27/clergy-tax-haven-coronavirus-richard-branson</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/offshore-tax-havens-how-do-work-what-done-change-paradise-papers-panama-bermuda-caymans-turks-caicos-a8039916.html\">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/offshore-tax-havens-how-do-work-what-done-change-paradise-papers-panama-bermuda-caymans-turks-caicos-a8039916.html</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/24/90bn-in-bills-since-2008-how-did-rbs-get-here-financial-crisis-\">https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/24/90bn-in-bills-since-2008-how-did-rbs-get-here-financial-crisis-</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/the-guardian-view-on-banks-break-up-big-finance-and-kick-the-watchdogs-too\">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/the-guardian-view-on-banks-break-up-big-finance-and-kick-the-watchdogs-too</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2020/03/22/if-uk-companies-want-a-bailout-there-must-be-conditions-attached-these-are-my-suggestions/\">If UK companies want a bailout there must be conditions attached: these are my suggestions</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211;

Months ago, I would have done anything to roll out of bed at 9 instead of 7, answer emails from my garden, and pour myself a glass of wine at 4pm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The positives of working from home are obvious – no commute, unlimited time with family members (if wanted…), and far more time for self-care. I, for one, have been loving my morning yoga sessions and the ability to go for a run when it isn’t still dark!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then again, it’s rather lovely having your personal place at work. You come in to see your mug waiting to be filled with your much-needed coffee. You go and grab yourself a piece of free fruit that sits in the free fruit bowl which tastes ten times more delicious because it’s free.&nbsp;But what a luxury to whip up a lavish pasta dish for lunch and enjoy it in the garden.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;I can’t be the only one craving my much loved avo olive baguette&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Though work lunches can be brilliant too! Okay, making yourself an elaborate meal at home is a real treat, but also, I miss Pret. And honestly, whether you love it or not… what is work without it? I can’t be the only one craving my much loved avo olive baguette (which I could probably make at home for a quarter of the price).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about those days when you venture out to a local food market, all troops in tow, having your fill of Ghanaian curry tasters before settling on that falafel wrap that you saw when you first arrived? Yes, before you ask, I do work in London.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One obstacle that comes with office life is finding the time to exercise – it’s hard enough waking up for work at silly o’clock in the morning, let alone putting your workout gear on and going for a jog before dawn.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t do that, you might go after work instead, getting home sticky and shattered at 8pm – god forbid you use your lunch break to exercise… who <em>are </em>you?!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should point out though, my daily step count rarely reaches double figures when I’m working from my living room.&nbsp;But taking care of errands and appointments is a breeze – there’s no stress about having to miss a few hours of work trekking to and from your local GP.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While deadlines still need to be met, they can be worked around with far less hassle when your office is at home.&nbsp;But oh, the distractions! Deliveries arriving (which may or may not be your twelfth ASOS order of the week), the dog barking, the dishwasher flooding – you don’t have to deal with any of that when you’re at work (until you come home and your whole house is drenched).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then in the office you have thirty-seven coffee breaks and table football and those long-winded discussions about whether bourbons or custard creams are better – unfortunately it seems that disruptions are rife either way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggie… the dreaded commute! Working from home means no rude, sweaty Londoners with faces of stone! And more importantly, no money needed to spend on it – think of the money saved! That must be a huge bonus, particularly in terms of the current state – a yearly travelcard costs not much under £2,000 for zones 1-3 and borders on £4,000 if you want all zones covered… that’s nearly one sixth of the average annual wage. Plus, you’d be making far better use of the house you’re probably paying a hefty rent (or mortgage) for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Home comforts are truly lovely – you can’t snack on ice cream (and have Netflix playing in the background) in the office, can you?&nbsp;However, this also makes it rather difficult to differentiate between work and home.&nbsp;Unless you have a set office space at home (which many people don’t), you could very well end up answering emails in the same place that you enjoy your family dinners or relax in your loungewear watching tv.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no real sense of liberation when the end of the working day is marked by you simply closing your laptop.&nbsp;I personally find something quite satisfying about getting dressed up for work, then coming home, changing into my PJs and knowing the working day is done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what about socialising? The working world adds a whole new dimension to your social life… there’s not a huge amount of work banter (I’m sorry!) when your colleague is your cat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;There are so many bonding opportunities – you may even meet your future partner&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming in and discussing what shenanigans you got up to over the weekend makes Monday mornings that tiny bit better. Crossing the line with your boss time and again and realising that actually they are hilarious and interesting and not scary at all. There are so many bonding opportunities – you may even meet your future partner (and that’s not uncommon!).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, when you’re surrounded by intelligent minds you learn so much, and so quickly! That is literally the point of learning on the job.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ease of asking for help is a massive bonus of office life. It’s much easier to grab someone’s attention or ask a quick question when they’re just across the desk from you – it all seems a bit more formal over Webex or Teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s certainly easier to have discussions, create pitches, and put an idea forward face-to-face; particularly in streams of work where you’re constantly needing to brainstorm together. I don’t think Zoom really cuts it – it’s not very personal at all… you need to be able to gesticulate!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what if the WiFi stops working at home? You can’t just call the IT guy and leave him to sort it out. You might not even get through to BT until tomorrow so bye bye data…&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong>So, what do we really want at the end of this?</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>I both praise and envy writers and freelancers. On one hand, working from a beach, a coffee shop or in the comfort of your own home is what many of us would have dreamed of in a life before lockdown.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, I’m sure we’d all agree that working remotely can be a lonely existence… there is an undoubtable lack of structure, overload of disruptions and general sense of solitude; we as humans thrive off social interaction, and no number of Zoom calls can fulfil that desire.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is a company really a company if there’s no shared workspace? Imagine starting your first day at work from home – you’d hardly know each other! No introductions, no feel for the atmosphere, and most importantly no company notebook! &nbsp;Either way, we can clearly function quite well from home, and this new knowledge should hopefully give people a bit more choice about their working space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working from home is the supposed dream, but having done eight weeks of it, it’s not really all it’s cracked up to be – the grass is always greener though, isn’t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like office life &#8211; I think it’s integral to work itself and I hope it will continue to play a part in the future of the working world. &nbsp;And while there are times when you sit at your desk longing to be enjoying the sunshine, part of me feels it’s all worth it for the sweet, sweet taste of after-work pints at the local beer garden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who knows? Maybe this is just preparing us for a new normal, and perhaps a future lies ahead that offers the best of both worlds…&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Lucy Robb</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/lucyrobb/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9acb0e76e8575bc3ea760b432b7a826a?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Lucy Robb\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/lucyrobb/\">Lucy Robb</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Specifically, ones I adopted in my teenage years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My room is a mess from all the outfits I’ve been meticulously planning and trying on for summer events that I’m never going to attend. Arguments with my mother are rife because no, I don’t want to paint her gangly toenails and yes, I did just take a bottle of wine up to my room for a Zoom quiz without asking. Any reasonable request to help out with a basic chore is met with an eyeroll. And if I spill a dribble of orange juice on the kitchen counter, you better believe I’m not clearing it up. Regrettably, this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The irony is that over the last five years I have successfully lived away from home; first at University up in Newcastle, then in Australia on a belated gap year and now in a flat in London. I’ve kept myself fed and watered, held down jobs (until now, cheers Corona) and organised my social life, but the second my foot crossed the threshold of my suburban family home on March 23 the “adult” me was invaded by a turbulent teen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With many other 20-somethings moving back to the mothership in the quest for free food and rent, it seems I’m not alone in feeling and acting in a regressive way. I have a friend who chooses to go to bed at 3am in order to wake up as late as possible with the aim of minimising time spent with his family, another who storms out the room every time a dinner debate turns sour, and my personal favourite is a photo I was sent by a friend of a huge gash down her back courtesy of her sister during a physical fight<em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;I certainly notice how my dad and his three siblings revert to their adolescent selves whenever they get together&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not hard to work out that this behaviour is partly down to the worldwide pandemic we’re currently experiencing and the frustrations and anxieties that come from that, but it’s also worth noting that we often act this way at Christmas or on a family holiday – no matter what age. I certainly notice how my dad and his three siblings revert to their adolescent selves whenever they get together; whether it’s sniggering over a sexual innuendo my granny accidentally made or the infamous ham hock incident of 2012, which saw my uncle hurl a whole leg of ham across the kitchen at my aunt in an act of rage. If our friends saw us act this way we would be mortified, so why do we feel so comfortable reverting to teenage behaviour at home?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did some googling, and it turns out there is actually a psychological reason. According to <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/12/132248/home-for-the-holidays-childhood-regression-psychology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">California-based psychologist Dr. Juli Fraga</a>, “one way to understand our regressive behaviour is to view it through the lens of classical conditioning. It&#8217;s a behavioural theory of psychology that says that there are stimuli that trigger old memories, which can spark regressive behaviours.” These stimuli can be anything from eating at your childhood dining table to sleeping in the same polaroid-covered bedroom that hosted sleepovers, alcohol smuggling, and, if lucky, the odd fondle. When returning to an environment so innately haunted by the moody ghost of teenage past, it’s hardly a surprise we become engulfed by it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of this, there is also the theory that families have specific systems and roles that keep them functioning. It seems my family are a stunning example of this; my parents were very hands on with the “adult” responsibilities such as cooking, cleaning and washing, whilst my brother and I (even at 18) were perfectly happy to stay in our lesser lane of ‘the children’, playing the contrasting roles of good child, bad child. Fraga explains that upon entering the old system, it’s natural to snap back into your well-rehearsed role. And this is the same for parents too – whether it be nagging about rooms or making snide comments about weight, when we return home parents often regress to their “parental” role, treating their adult kids like children. It seems to me that problems arise when each party expects the other to have now adapted their role in some way, but doesn’t adapt themselves. Guess what Mumsie? I’m not going to help out with the hoovering if each time we get in an argument you’re going to scold me like an underaged youth by cutting off my wine supply at dinner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being back at home in this nationwide lockdown with no real time scale and a diminish in responsibilities (particularly for those of us on furlough) only amplifies the behaviour that occurs over the short duration of Christmas. It’s even harder to suppress tensions and old habits, and it can become increasingly frustrating when you find yourself acting and being treated like a teenager. If you’ve noticed an irritable regression, take comfort in knowing that it is psychologically normal and you are only one of the many house-bound adult children experiencing it right now. That being said, rather than stewing over the situation, try to recognise your behaviour and <em>maybe</em> make a conscious effort to help out after dinner, rather than slinking off to the sofa to continue your incessant binge of Netflix. If you can bear it, it might even be worth talking to your parents about how you expect to be treated now you’re an independent “adult”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If all else fails, it’s possible that as lockdown continues your behaviour and that of those around you may start to naturally ease up anyway as new routines and systems are established, creating that ever important ‘new normal’.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Molly Stringer</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/mollystringer/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2ada72bbacdaad734a357c5da97bc223?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Molly Stringer\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/mollystringer/\">Molly Stringer</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Cold one to rinse out your toothpaste in the morning? Go on then! Eleven Heinekens for elevenses? WHO’S GOING TO STOP YOU!?!?!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my friends, savour the illicit thrill of being able to crack open an icy craft beer and drink it during Good Morning Britain – it won’t last forever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prost.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>10 &#8211; Peroni</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>They invented ravioli, we invented the sausage roll; their language sounds like a sonnet, ours sounds like an exuberant badger burrowing in the earth (*cough* Bojo); they’ve got Michaelangelo, we’ve got Vicky Pollard. When it comes to cultural prestige and general exotica, Italy firmly has the upper hand. But – Peroni? Is that really all you’ve got guys?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peroni is like the conversation you have with your other half’s parents: <em>‘a drink, Mrs Harrison? Ahh, a peroni would be lovely, thanks’</em>. Pleasant enough, a little flat, lacking in imagination &#8212;&nbsp;and infused with a sense of duty.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ABV</strong>: 4.7%</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Situational sustenance</strong>: Watching Marley and Me with your little sister and crying softly. OR. Forced, stony faced, to join a virtual bottomless brunch with the self-satisfied couple who love referring to each other as ‘this one’ on social media.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>9 &#8211; Corona&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll level with you: this one’s a pity vote. 2020 will go down as the year when Corona (the beer) got fully shafted by Corona (the deadly virus). 38% of Americans said they would never drink it again, while 16% said they were ‘confused’ about the connection between the two. Awkward. Corona is the frat bro of beers: gym shorts and Netjets cap on, fist-pumping to Diplo and ready to ‘rage’ by 1pm. Obnoxious, predictable –&nbsp;but still fun to get tanked with.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ABV: 4.5%</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Situational sustenance: Afternoon chilling in the sun on the ‘lough pretending to read while madly refreshing instagram.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>8 &#8211; Buxton &#8211; Shelterstone IPA</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Can beer from a can ever taste as good as beer from a bottle? I would like to put forward a theory that: no, it cannot. Plus, there’s the size issue: 330ml in can form is less than 330ml in bottle form (don’t @ me) – but when clutching a 440ml-er, I feel less ‘switched-on city slicker’ and more ‘park bench-dweller with a thirst for Frosty Jacks’.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This passive-aggressively ‘vegan’ nectar (is other beer filtered through the ribs of a sentient beast?) which says it all, really. It’s aromatic, cloudy, and probably works in an artisan coffee shop part time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ABV: 5.6%</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Situational sustenance: Drowning your sorrows after being savagely dumped over the phone; your other half thinks you need to ‘work on yourself’.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>7 &#8211; Siren &#8211; Soundwave IPA</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This ones the goth kid at school who wrote angry poems and smelled like Patchouli oil – but ended up with a double first from Cambridge. Soundwave is fruity, edgy and mysterious, with a tropical mouthfeel leading into a bitter aftertaste. Or as one keen drinker described it: dank, bro.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ABV: 5.6%</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Situational sustenance: Nerve-settler pre-Zoom date with your latest Hinge date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>6 &#8211; Pistonhead &#8211; Kustom Lager</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If this weren’t lockdown but a glorious parallel universe, Pistonhead is the lukewarm can you reach for circa 8am at Glasto: coated in a film of your own filth, just pissed in a bottle, confused, treacherously hungover. Pistonhead is the beer that brings you back from the dead: one sip down and you’re raring to go again (yes, in the same pants you wore yesterday). It has a rich, malty fragrance with hints of syrup and a moreish mouthfeel. In other words, the stuff of legend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ABV: 4.6%</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Situational sustenance: Asked to leave Sainsburys because you’re ‘frightening the customers’.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>5 &#8211; Skinny Lager</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This one’s the guy you lived with at uni who always left his ketchup-smeared plates in the sink and had worse chat than David Brent. Now, inexplicitly, earns six figures, is going out with a 10 and drives an Audi. Smug bastard. I might be bitter but Skinny Lager certainly isn’t: despite its holier-than-thou branding (vegan! Gluten free! Kosher! Only 89 calories!) it&#8217;s delicious, with a clean, crisp flavour and a zesty finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ABV: 4.0%&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Situational sustenance: Quiz night with your mates. Hilarity ensues as the fool in question spews up their one too many.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>4 &#8211; Beavertown</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Fruit in beer is an association that annoys me. When you’re on the cusp of getting a round in mere minutes before kick off and – oh – what’s this – a mullet-sporting bloke named ‘Frank’ has pushed ahead of you? No no, that’s fine, go ahead Frank. But wait. He’s ordering ‘four half-pints of Blue Moons, please’. Drafts run out because literally no one drinks it. Now there’s no orange slices. The bartender has to nip to the shop, be back in 5. FOR GODSAKE, FRANK!!! Beavertown doesn’t annoy me though. Far from it. It’s light, hazy, mild, with a moreish citrus twang from its blood orange infusion. One for the ages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ABV: 5.5%<em>’</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Situational sustenance: A summer evening. Rack of lamb roasting away. Half-cut, content, and wondering whether <em>‘Corona is nature’s way of repairing itself, y’know?’</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>3 &#8211; The Wild Beer Co &#8211; Bibble</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Muy Buena! The WBC website claims Bibble is its ‘gateway Wild beer’, and I can confirm I’ve huffed on its hops every day since a dear friend introduced me; I assume the second B is a typo, because drinking it is a religious experience. It’s so tasty that I’ve been dangerously close to speeding around my native Surrey and doing holdups when I don’t get my fix –&nbsp;then I remember everyone here only drinks champagne. This session ale is the perfect fit for a can &#8211; fast, easy and delicious. It also comes by the barrel –&nbsp;and the way lockdown’s going, I’m not far off keg standing this bad boy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ABV: 4.2%</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Situational sustenance: A loose night of keg stands and drunken debauchery with Auntie Jill and her weird dachshund.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>2 &#8211; Lockdown Living &#8211; Isolation lager</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The phoenix that emerged from the ashes. The rainbow after the thunderstorm. The beer that lockdown gave birth to. This is a fruity, light and incredibly sessionable lager. As the packaging says, “one of those beers you drink 9 by mistake’ –&nbsp;and that’s just at lunchtime. HQ are currently brewing a Freedom IPA, and – judging by how good their Iso Lager is – I’d happily swap spend another month as a celibate, nocturnal hermit in social Antarctica for a sip of it. Plus, 50% of all profits go to the NHS so I like to think I’m doing my bit for the welfare state by inhaling these by the dozen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ABV: 4.6%&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Situational sustenance: Lunchtime BBQ. 27 degrees. Aggressively sunburnt down one side of your face. Accidentally given your whole family food poisoning with out-of-date sausages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>1 &#8211; Camden &#8211; Heroes thank you lager</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe Wicks. Tiger King. Banana bread. Shaved heads. 5k runs. Endless, joyless organised fun. Lockdown has been a bumpy ride. It’s been impossible not to let it affect you, both physically and mentally (if I was weird in social situations before, how much have I regressed now!?). I’ve changed. You’ve changed. The world has changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But one thing that’s stayed the same is Hells lager, and here –&nbsp;repackaged with all proceeds from every can donated to support healthcare charities – it takes the top spot. Clean, crisp and dry, this hybrid between a Pilsner and a Helles lager is nicely balanced and just slithers down. So why the Hells not….drink one (or ten) now!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Situational sustenance: It’s Saturday. The sun is shining. The lads are blowing up the group chat. You switch on BBC1: there’s Bojo, badgering away like a lunatic. But what’s this&#8230;? Special service announcement. Pubs are… BACK OPEN?!!?!</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Pints Enjoyed, part of Life Enjoyed Ltd.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h5>About Pints Enjoyed</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>We believe that a pint enjoyed is not a pint wasted.

Below, I&#8217;ve listed 5 of the most mouth-watering, classic, satisfaction-heavy meals to tickle your tastebuds. Get cooking!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Fish and Chips&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern English cuisine reflects the various cultures and ethnicities which enrich our society today. A fusion of tastes which trace their origins back to the colonial days of the British Empire. The list of more traditional, native English foods reads like a who&#8217;s who of much loved winter warmers. Steak &amp; kidney pie, sausage &amp; mash and Sunday roast, to name a few. Jostling for pride of place on the mantelpiece with England’s other traditional favourites, fish &amp; chips is a well respected juggernaut of the comfort food world. Whether it be takeaway or home made, the nostalgia of fish and chips is undeniable, conjuring up memories of childhood trips to the beach or Fridays at school. The naked chef himself has written loads of great recipes over the years but if you’re looking for specifics, Jamie Oliver’s ‘Jamie&#8217;s Dinners’ is a real winner. Best consumed with copious amounts of alcohol and no plans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-1.jpeg?fit=640%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1272\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-1.jpeg?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-1.jpeg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-1.jpeg?resize=819%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 819w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C960&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-1.jpeg?resize=1229%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1229w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-1.jpeg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Pizza</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Like players in a rugby union team, pizzas come in a variety of shapes and sizes. From the fully loaded Dominoes Mighty Meaty to the classic margarita from Pizza Express and everything in between, there’s something for everyone. A home made attempt means you get to decide where your pizza fits on that scale. Like Jackson Pollock staring at a blank canvas, the opportunity for creative chaos presents itself. Whether it be pepperoni (legendary status achieved) or pineapple (welcome to Broadmoor) there is no end to the various and potential combinations of ingredients. There really is no hard and fast way to go about this but for a great dough recipe I’d look to BBC Good Food to get you out the starting blocks. In the immortal words of celebrated genius Albert Einstein “creativity is intelligence having fun”. Be smart with those combos and the flavours will look after themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-3.jpeg?fit=640%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1276\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-3.jpeg?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-3.jpeg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-3.jpeg?resize=819%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 819w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-3.jpeg?resize=768%2C960&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-3.jpeg?resize=1229%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1229w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-3.jpeg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Paella&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>From sweet churros and turrón to stunning seafood and tapas, the exuberance of the Spanish people is reflected in their cuisine. A mixture of old world and new traditions, Spanish food has been shaped over the centuries through a complex history of invasions and conquests, as well as the prevailing climate and geography. As important to Spanish culture as Matadors and Raúl, Paella is Spain’s National dish and rightly so. A genuine food medley if there ever was one, the scope to add a whole host of weird and wonderful ingredients makes the dish what it is. The food equivalent of a Flamenco dance, this crowd-pleaser always takes centre stage at international food festivals or street feasts. For a great recipe check out ‘A Bird in the Hand’ by Diana Henry. Though more well known for it’s general chicken recipes, the paella recipe in here is out of this world. Provecho!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"550\" height=\"367\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Paella-1.jpg?resize=550%2C367&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1267\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Paella-1.jpg?w=550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Paella-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Paella-1.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Kofta Burger&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a lot to be said in life for an old classic. Unchallenged, unchanged, the original and best.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The list of classics is extensive but somewhere near the top I’d expect to see a dish synonymous with the American dream. Nothing says the USA quite like a good old fashioned Stars and Stripes double bacon cheeseburger. Every once in a while, however, a new player rears it’s head to challenge the status quo. To poke a finger at the establishment. To test an old-school classic. Enter the beef kofta burger from Sabrina Ghayour. A Middle Eastern twist on the all-american staple. Spices and herbs combine to form a new school fusion capable of converting even the most traditionalist food connoisseur. The Five-Guys-esque cheese filled classic will never be knocked off its perch. Neither Shake Shack nor Byron. However variety is, as they say, the spice of life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1505\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1.jpeg?fit=640%2C669&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1277\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1.jpeg?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1.jpeg?resize=287%2C300&amp;ssl=1 287w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1.jpeg?resize=980%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 980w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1.jpeg?resize=768%2C803&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1.jpeg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Club Sandwich&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Day one on holiday. No sun cream &#8211; check. Sprawled out on a deck chair by the pool like an overly optimistic beached whale. You draw the attention of a waiter and order a nice cold pint of lager. Now we&#8217;re talking. There’s only one thing missing from this picture and it ain’t a good holiday read. The missing piece of this fabulously British jigsaw puzzle is a holy grail of holiday grub. The Club Sandwich. While there are no rules to this free-for all, bottoms up, food bonanza, there are some rules. Triple deck, chicken, lettuce, tomato and bacon are a must. The fried egg is also an absolute essential. After that it’s time to get creative. We’re talking condiments, extra meats, the often whispered about but rarely ever seen fourth deck. I’m not going to point you in the direction of any specific recipe as it would be against the nature of the club to be confined to a page. Sun’s out, Club’s out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Food Enjoyed, part of Life Enjoyed Ltd. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/foodenjoyed/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/52013c3c8481143666f373fc9320b601?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Food Enjoyed\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/foodenjoyed/\">Food Enjoyed</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

It may sound obvious, but organising your gear as much as possible can really help with this. Work out exactly what you need (and we mean <em>need — </em>it’s nice to have your gimbal at the top of a mountain, but is it necessary?), think carefully about how you pack your bag and try to learn where everything is. You’ll maximise space and save time when shooting. Need a new battery? Inside top pocket. Need your ND filters? External side pocket. Get to know your gear and your bag and you’ll save yourself more space and time than you thought&nbsp;possible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image1-6-2.jpeg?resize=640%2C427&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1264\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image1-6-2-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image1-6-2-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image1-6-2-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image1-6-2-scaled.jpeg?resize=693%2C462&amp;ssl=1 693w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image1-6-2-scaled.jpeg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image1-6-2-scaled.jpeg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4>2. Get a tripod &#8211; and take it with you</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe an obvious one, and we’re sure that plenty of you are doing this anyway, but it is absolutely essential to get those bangers that you’re after. There are some amazing, lightweight tripods on the market that will clip to the side of your camera bag and be ready to go whenever you need them. They are obviously great if you want to take pictures of yourself looking over an amazing vista, but we use them more for long exposures. Whether you want to get that glassy water on a lake, or smooth out the motion on a waterfall, or capture the stars in all of their glory, you will want to set a slow shutter speed. As a result,&nbsp; you’ll need the camera to be as steady as possible, so a tripod is absolutely essential.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image2-2-2-scaled.jpeg?resize=640%2C427&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1263\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image2-2-2-scaled.jpeg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image2-2-2-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image2-2-2-scaled.jpeg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image2-2-2-scaled.jpeg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4>3. Get to know your camera</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, saving time can be crucial when you’re travelling. A big way to help with this is to get to know your camera and it&#8217;s settings. If you’re fumbling through the settings to try and change the aperture, or the auto-focus, or the ISO, not only are you wasting time but you also risk missing the perfect shot. If you can cycle through the settings with ease and get to exactly where you need to be without thinking, you’ll be running and gunning and getting the bangers that you want — all with the right settings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1714\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image3-2-scaled.jpeg?fit=640%2C428&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1256\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image3-2-scaled.jpeg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image3-2-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image3-2-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C685&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image3-2-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C514&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image3-2-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1028&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image3-2-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1371&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image3-2-scaled.jpeg?resize=150%2C100&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image3-2-scaled.jpeg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image3-2-scaled.jpeg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4>4. Get up early &#8211; yep, I’m afraid so!</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a big one. Getting up early is a crucial step to taking those photos that you’ll be proud of. Whether it is to miss the crowd at a landmark, catch the sunrise or to get to the right spot for golden hour, we promise you that the early alarm will be worth it when you see the end result. The picture below is a sunrise in Norway. We had hiked the day before, set up our tents too late and had an awful night’s sleep. It would have been so easy to ignore the alarm and get an extra couple of hours of shuteye. Instead, we unzipped the tent at 5.00am, set up the tripod and got shooting. It’s one of our favourite photos, partly because of the&nbsp; end-product, but partly because of the story behind it. You won’t regret getting up, we promise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image4-2.jpeg?resize=640%2C427&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1261\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image4-2-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image4-2-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image4-2-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image4-2-scaled.jpeg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image4-2-scaled.jpeg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4>5. Look through your eyes, not just the camera&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are lucky enough to travel around the world, see beautiful places and experience different cultures, you want to make sure that you take it all in.

It is therefore vital that we continue to raise awareness of the strain that is put on our mental wellbeing during these significant transitional phases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all must &nbsp;be more alert to the potential challenges we may face during these significant changes in our lives. If we are better prepared, more self-aware and the correct support mechanisms are in place, we will be better equipped to prevent the onset of ill mental health altogether. Whilst organisations should take the brunt of the responsibility here, becoming more aware as individuals of the changes that are occuring in our lives will undoubtedly help us reduce the likelihood of mental health breakdowns.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter of your age, change can be a frightening and daunting thing. In any instance, especially if multiple changes are coinciding, it is easy to become overwhelmed to a point which can lead to the deterioration of one’s own mental health. Plato once said <em>“be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle</em>”, which I think remains as pertinent as ever to this day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Prioritising Mental Health During a Transition</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Going from junior to senior school, from school to university, from university into that first job, and from functional head in a business to general manager&#8230; These are all life changing transitions that we experience as we grow and excel in life. Though, it is often during these changes that our mental health can suffer. We must get better in supporting others through the changes and transitions in their lives, and become more aware of the fragility of the mind during these periods.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take leaving university for example, the number of changes that occur in your life as you leave is unprecedented. More often than not, the city you live in will change, the people you live with will not be the same, and you will get used to a new structure of your daily life. To add to this, there is an immense perceived pressure to transition swiftly into a new era of your life and begin work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The combination of these factors puts enormous strain on the mind and we must be aware of the potential risks to our mental wellbeing that this time period poses. Ensuring that our mental health is at the forefront of our awareness during these times is pivotal in keeping us healthy. Fortunately, there are support options available, such as the Thriving From The Start network, which focuses primarily on this key transitional phase.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h5><em><strong>Anastasia Vinnikova</strong></em></h5>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Wellbeing Lead at The Bank of England &amp; Steering Committee member of the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://citymha.org.uk/thriving-from-the-start/\" target=\"_blank\">CMHA’s Thriving from the Start Network</a>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>The Education to Employment Transition</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The transition between education and employment is particularly difficult, and can have a significant impact on mental health. In 2018, the<a href=\"http://citymha.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CMHA_Making-it-Work_Final.pdf\"> City Mental Health Alliance found</a> that 69% of students would not describe themselves as mentally healthy, and 64% were concerned about how their mental health may impact their chances of securing a first job upon completion of studies. There are many contributing factors as to why this is a difficult time, and can vary from individual to individual depending on their unique circumstances. However, some of the key reasons can include:</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong><em>The nature of change</em></strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Change itself can be a very scary thing. University is an important experience which spans many years, and the prospect of having to leave the freedom and independence of study for the (perceived) rigidity of working life can be very overwhelming&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><em><strong>Expectations of perfection</strong></em></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The graduate job market is very challenging at the moment, and increasingly there is a perceived expectation that students should be able to secure the perfect job immediately upon completion of their degree. Pressure from institutions who are ranked on the ‘employability’ of their students and cultures amongst course-mates where employment prospects are compared can create a toxic need for an unattainable level of perfection.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><em><strong>Leaving support networks</strong></em></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only can it be a shorter waiting time to access formal university wellbeing support, such as counselling, students are also surrounded by informal support networks in their peers and friends. The end of university signifies a time when people return back to their hometowns, or move on to follow employment prospects, and access to both formal and informal support networks to which they are accustomed can be lost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although easier said than done, it is important during this transition to remember that comparing ourselves to others can be a toxic and unproductive exercise. While it may seem that everyone knows what they would like to do with their career, and that many peers are receiving numerous job offers, the reality is that more likely than not you are all in the same boat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also important to consider how to keep support systems running. For example, if you are receiving counselling from your university, it would be beneficial to speak with the counsellor for how to transition into therapy wherever you will be living after your studies. Equally, it is putting processes in place to stay in contact with friends and peers who may not be in the usual close proximity to you once your studies finish.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, more and more organisations dedicate themselves to ensuring they create an inclusive working culture which prioritises the wellbeing of their employees. When researching prospective employers, as well as the usual things we may look for (such as career progression, benefits and rewards, office location etc.) consider whether you can find signs of tangible efforts to provide mental health support for their staff.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4>Being Alert to a Breakdown</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no easy checklist for identifying whether someone is struggling with their mental health. The manifestations of an issue with psychological wellbeing can be both emotional and physical, and will vary greatly from person to person. The main thing is spotting a change in behaviour. This may mean that someone who is usually very positive, becomes full of anger, or someone who usually sleeps very regularly begins to over-sleep, it can even be that someone who usually does not care very much about their appearance begins to focus on their self-image more than they typically would. However, to be able to spot a change in someone we have to keep in regular contact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The power of checking-in with someone is immense if you are keen to keep a finger on the pulse of the mental wellbeing of those around you. It can be very scary to open up to someone about how you are feeling, so the question of ‘how are things?’ can not just signify to the person that you are interested in how they are feeling, but also give you an opportunity to spot any changes in their behaviour or demeanour. An important thing to remember is that people are unlikely to answer honestly the first time. So (gently) ask twice if you think you’re not getting a true response.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Finding Support </strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, there are many fantastic organisations which can support young people’s mental health as they transition into employment – charities like Young Minds and Student Minds offer great services and resources particularly during education. Others like the City Mental Health Alliance, and in particular their early careers specific network, Thriving from the Start, look at bridging the gap and ensuring no one falls through the cracks by providing awareness raising, profiling mentally healthy workplace behaviours, and providing a community where young people can share their mental health experiences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Geoff McDonald and Anastasia Vinnikova</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4>About the Authors</h4>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"641\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Geoff.jpg?resize=640%2C641&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1239\" data-full-url=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Geoff.jpg?fit=737%2C738&amp;ssl=1\" data-link=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/?attachment_id=1239\" class=\"wp-image-1239\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Geoff.jpg?w=737&amp;ssl=1 737w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Geoff.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Geoff.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Geoff.jpg?resize=500%2C500&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"639\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Anastasia.jpg?resize=640%2C639&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1238\" data-full-url=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Anastasia.jpg?fit=730%2C729&amp;ssl=1\" data-link=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/?attachment_id=1238\" class=\"wp-image-1238\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Anastasia.jpg?w=730&amp;ssl=1 730w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Anastasia.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Anastasia.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Anastasia.jpg?resize=500%2C500&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h5><em><strong>Geoff McDonald</strong></em></h5>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://geoffmcdonald.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><em>Geoff</em></strong></a> is the co-founder of Minds@Work, whose purpose is to inspire and empower individuals to break the stigma of mental ill health in their own organisations.

There are chilling similarities to the Nixon and Reagan era ‘wars on drugs’- a choice of phrase that is semantically similar in that by waging war on a concept, there can be no clear end point to the ‘war’. Indeed, in recent history, we’ve had the ‘war on drugs’, the ‘war on terror’ and now the ‘war against Coronavirus’. With each of these examples, politicians and their subordinates parrot these catchphrases to the masses, using wartime rhetoric to justify myriad human rights abuses, erosions of civil liberties, and subjugations of legal due process. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Tough on crime’ rhetoric is used as a political weapon; a Texas governor once said, ‘no one ever lost an election by being too tough on crime’. But I wanted to delve a little deeper into what the consequences of such rhetoric are. I want to ask why and indeed who this might all be hurting? In recent years we have seen welfare being used as a stick with which to beat the poor, the most vulnerable, the most ignored, and the most forgotten. Picture this example, an all too frequent reality:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s Friday night at HMP Wandsworth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s Friday night, which means a mentally ill drug addict is about to be <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111190524\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>released from their current sentence</em></strong></a> with £47.50.  This amount is set by statute <strong><em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/prisoners-being-tipped-out-jail-14806684\" target=\"_blank\">but is often not even enough to pay for a train ticket</a></em></strong>. Our released prisoner has never had a job and grew up in care without the familial support most take for granted. In prison he had no work, the closest he got was attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and even then that was only when he was let out of his cell to attend them. A rarity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to bureaucratic incompetence and one of the most malicious pieces of legislation ever drafted (perhaps dwarfed only by Chris Grayling’s proposed prisoner book ban), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/dec/05/prison-book-ban-unlawful-court-chris-grayling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><em>prisoners are unable to claim state benefits</em></strong></a> for several months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon release from prison he is denied access to welfare for 2 months.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On that Friday night, he walks out into the world and looks for his next score. Within a few hours, he’s run out of money, but he is hungry. He walks into Sainsbury’s and pockets an all-day breakfast sandwich. He (shock horror) looked suspicious on entry and was followed by security. Within minutes he was arrested for shoplifting. Within hours he is back at HMP Wandsworth from whence he came earlier that day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be numerous court hearings, police evidence meetings, witness-callings, and legal-aid costs before he is sentenced again to spend the next several years in prison. Now, thanks to changes in the 2000s, previous convictions and prison records can now be introduced as evidence for the prosecution. This legislation was passed in response to victims’ movements in cases were sexual offences were committed. Quantitative studies on such cases indicate conclusively that sex offenders are more likely to offend again than any other offender. Given the especially heinous nature of such crimes, and the statistical likelihood of recidivism, perhaps it is palatable to allow previous convictions into evidence at trial. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the government of the day chose a blunt instrument and instead co-opted these victims’ movements to allow previous convictions into all trials regardless of severity. This turns the presumption of innocence on its head. The mass inclusion of previous offences makes it more likely than not that the jury will be influenced. Try telling a jury that a man with two previous petty shoplifting convictions is innocent until proven guilty. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image1-5.jpeg?resize=640%2C360&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1224\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image1-5.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image1-5.jpeg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image1-5.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image1-5.jpeg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image1-5.jpeg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image1-5.jpeg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image1-5.jpeg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But back to our story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our released prisoner will likely spend several more years in HMP Wandsworth. For him, this is easier than being on the streets. For him, removal from society is (perversely, you might say) less painful than being forced to live in it. That is, in a society that has consistently forgotten and alienated him.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Hume wrote that empathy is the glue which holds society together. Much of that sentiment rings true today. And we need it more than ever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the next time you read a ‘tough on crime’ soundbite in the Evening Standard, or you hear of a new Bill promising to lock more people up for longer, consider the effects of such policy: increased reoffending rates, more and more people becoming trapped in the cycle of offending. The reoffending rate in the UK over the last decade has steadily held above 40%. In Norway and Sweden, the average is half that. Rather than attacking crime at the symptom, we need a joined-up and holistic public health approach to find a solution to the root cause of the problem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The case of Glasgow shows us that we already have a model of a better approach to treating crime and how effective it can be. Since ex-police officer John Carnochan reframed violent crime as a public health issue in the early 2000s, Glasgow has moved from having one of the highest murder rates in Europe to a half of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, next time you hear a politician promising to be ‘tough on crime’, remember this approach is ultimately to the detriment of the most marginalised, as well as society as a whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Will Marsden</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/willmarsden/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3eaa70b82c5b76613c47667411c56339?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Will Marsden\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/willmarsden/\">Will Marsden</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Apologies, but perhaps I use this almost offensive cliche because it is the only real ‘life experience’ I have so far, being 23 years old. Really, I am still growing up. But, I wonder, when do we stop? When, if ever, can we claim that how we are, right now, is how we will always be from now on? That we have gone to the school of youth, taken the tests, and graduated into the mature world? At what point can we truly accredit ourselves with a statement such as ‘I have grown up’?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can confidently say I don’t know the answer to these questions. I suspect, in fact, that there is no single answer. To this extent, I won’t try to answer them, but simply explore them as they appear in my own mind, in the hope of inviting you to muse over them too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An adult, according to the <a href=\"https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/adult\">Cambridge Dictionary</a>, is ‘A person or animal that has grown to full size and strength’. I find this perplexing. There are plenty of 16 and 17 year olds who are both bigger and stronger than I am. Conversely, I am also bigger and stronger than plenty of, say, 35 year olds. If you asked me, I would confidently label said teenagers as mere kids &#8211; and so what about their size. I suggest that the 35 year old would, equally confidently, tar me with the same brush.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly, we all reach ‘full size and strength’ at radically different stages. Can ‘an adult’ be an arbitrary scale? An adult is, well… a <em>thing</em>, isn’t it? In any case, who deems us to be of full size and strength? I am not naively denying that being an adult has at least something to do with the evolution of our physical state, however, the scope of biology alone is not wide enough to determine adulthood. It’s just one piece of a much larger, and far more complex puzzle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here in England, and in the majority of the world, we are recognised as an adult at 18 years old, insofar as we obtain full legal control, and therefore responsibility, over ourselves. In America, it is 21 years old. In Indonesia, Myanmar and Yemen, at the ripe old age of 15, one would be considered an adult. The lack of both global consensus and sound reasoning behind these varying ages lead me to believe that the legal definition of an adult, just like that of biology, is a bit of a blunt instrument of measurement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can a particular age decree one an adult, and another a child? Granted, there has to be <em>some</em> point at which the laws change. I firmly agree &#8211; and would hope you do too &#8211; that in a court of law, a 16 year old should be tried differently to a 25 year old for the same crime. The point I am making is that being an adult is not like flicking a switch; we don’t wake up on our 15th, 18th, 21st, or any other of our birthdays with a renewed state of mind. Nor with a capability, or outlook, that we didn’t have the day before. Certainly not with a shift in ‘self&#8217; so big that we can firmly, with unflinching resolution claim ‘I am now an adult. I have grown up’.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have, in the usual sense of the phrase, left home. I have a full time job in London and pay rent for a room in a shared house. As I mentioned, I’m 23. Truthfully, though, do any of these trivial factors make me any more of an adult than the next person? I still talk to both my parents regularly. I know that, worst come to absolute worst, I am lucky enough that I could be bailed out. I have, should I need, a room to sleep in at either of their houses, and I am fully aware that I would be welcome back whenever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is the 18 year old who has started their own business on Instagram, saved enough to put a deposit down on a house and moved into it with a partner, more ‘grown up’ than me? What about, God forbid, the 17 year old who has been deployed to a battalion in the army and is running around with a fully loaded assault rifle? Does that make them an adult? Conversely, does anyone have the right to judge that the 28 year old who lives at home and works part-time at their local supermarket is not really ‘grown up’?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this illustrates the issue that is the title of this piece. There seems to be no clear and obvious answer as to whether or not I am an adult!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps it would be more appropriate to consider the notion of adulthood as a journey &#8211; a journey that is entirely personal to the individual. Growing up could mean a detachment from one’s parents and increased, or total, self-sufficiency and responsibility. It could simply mean getting older. Personally, I believe that becoming an adult has at least a small something to do with ‘stepping into oneself’ &#8211; for want of a more concrete and, frankly, less wishy-washy term. By this I mean an increased awareness of one’s place in the world, how we relate to others (and indeed how others relate to us), and a greater underlying understanding of ourselves. By these measures, though, it could very easily be argued that we are constantly in a state of ‘growing’ up, and never actually ‘grown’ up. Is that the key?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a world where it is, by and large, decided when to eat, sleep, work and even when to have fun, we could perhaps do with a relaxation of the rules surrounding the concept of being an adult. Of course, not so much so that our entire legal system rests on one flimsy crutch, but enough so that there is both time and space for us all to <em>grow up at our own pace.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being told, by an uninspiring forty-something, sat comfortably on their high-horse; ‘God, you haven’t even started life yet, you are SO young!’ is <em>really</em> irritating. Maybe, though, this in fact illuminates the truth of the matter; I feel ‘grown up’ to me, but hardly at all to someone else. What is pertinent is how we perceive ourselves to be, and consequently how we behave; nobody should be able to tell you that you are, or are not, grown up &#8211; that is for you to embody. I reiterate; doesn’t some allowance needs to be made for us to grow up at our own pace?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot more questions seem to have been asked, rather than answered. At least in my mind, there seems to be no universal truth to adulthood. For now, though, I think it’s worth stressing that no matter what age you are, and whatever stage you are at, worrying that you should be at some stage that other ‘grown ups’ are at, is fruitless. It seems far more reasonable to suggest that growing up and becoming an adult is individual, dependant on circumstances, and to a large extent, <em>up to you.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you understand what works for you, I encourage you to engage in some self-reflection &#8211; surely now is as good a time as any &#8211; and to ask yourself that question:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>‘Am I an adult yet?’</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Gabriel Godfrey-Janni </em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/gabrielgodfreyjanni/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c13e5f76d411d9a704c182535e425a70?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Gabriel Godfrey-Janni\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/gabrielgodfreyjanni/\">Gabriel Godfrey-Janni</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

It was the last place on earth I wanted to be. As I flew over London, undeniably dazzling in the darkness, my heart was broken at the sight. Far too soon, my magical life in Beirut had come to a dramatic halt. Only six weeks in, destiny had apparently yanked me back in the direction of home and signalled life abroad was not to be. But destiny was not the enemy; it was of course, the coronavirus. It had reared its ugly head and tore me away from my dewy Middle Eastern existence. The growing seriousness of the pandemic, both in Lebanon and the UK left me with little choice but to make the agonising call to return home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, as my first post-uni job in London was ending and I struggled to locate my next step, I began to realise now was the time to go and live abroad. If I didn’t go now, it would never happen. I would be four years down the line stuck in the city’s relentless rut, wishing I had spent time in another country, full of regret and Pret. So, I decided I was going to move to Beirut; to work, live, and learn how they do it on the other side of the world. I had a burgeoning interest in Arabic and journalism, plus I had heard only praise for the city, the people, the food and the nightlife.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;I was nervous but ready to touch down in unknown territory&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Sounds an easy decision doesn’t it? Well, the thing is it was. Of course, prior to heading out I endlessly bothered anyone and everyone who had ever been to Lebanon or attempted to learn Arabic for intel. I shamelessly exploited my unrealistically large pool of Facebook friends for answers, and pestered parents&#8217; colleagues’ colleagues for connections. I was nervous but ready to touch down in unknown territory and had mentally (as well as physically) removed myself from London, and was content to see the back of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the get-go I felt settled and happy in Beirut. I have pondered why this was, but I think mainly because I arrived into an apartment decorated with a fantastic trio of British expats who took me under their wing and lurched me into Lebanese life. My day-to-day consisted of Arabic classes at a language school, building up contacts and looking for a job at a local newspaper, which arose just before I left. Not to mention the frequent antics at bars and house parties that really were on every street corner. Within days I decided I would be there for the year. I relished the independence: being able to do whatever I liked, when I liked, with whoever I liked. There was none of the exhausting who/what/when/why that can be so suffocating in circles back home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So after all that, as I accepted my fate and surrendered to the global health pandemic, I knew one thing: I would be back. Speaking to family and friends now, I stick firmly with the line: ‘My adventure in Lebanon has been put on pause’ as opposed to stopped and erased from the DVD player of life. The hopefulness of one day pressing play, hearing the jolts of activation and letting life play out once more is important to me. Hanging onto little positives right now is more valid than ever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn’t leave the UK because I wasn’t happy at home, but I just couldn’t settle with the idea of spending yet another Friday night in a pub followed by a Saturday and Sunday drowning in Deliveroo and dissatisfaction and pretending that this was what life was about. What always nudged me, was that London wasn’t leaving and if I had the opportunity to venture out, why not just try it? Life is long but also short. A couple of years away could be filled with the richest and most colourful adventures compared with another few years in London. How many new memories could one make strolling the same streets, doing indistinguishable deeds, week in, week out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite international travel seeming literally a world away right now, our hopes do not have to be. It might feel as if the lights have gone out, but now is a prime time to dream and research. It will be safe to travel again. The virus has reminded us that life is fragile and consequently, it is more relevant than ever to act on your ambitions. We are all guilty of fantasising about a different job, daydreaming about New York or Copenhagen, mulling over life in Melbourne.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Every goal begins with the ambition, the idea.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are considering it, you are a step closer. Every goal begins with the ambition, the idea. Yes, this does sound like a lot of hot-air, but if it launches you forward then who cares?&nbsp; Don’t be deterred by career fears. Stepping outside your comfort zone and achieving anything abroad is a challenge in itself, and you will be respected for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are young, lucky to be fit and able with budding minds that are malleable and spongey. Our brains are waiting to be soaked in strange sights, smells and feelings. And where better to find them than in a new country?</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Rosabel Crean </em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/rosabelcrean/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c7dc7433eeaadc1d52a425f70460a50c?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Rosabel Crean\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/rosabelcrean/\">Rosabel Crean</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

You find a dazzling leather-like trench coat, deep blue, but threaded with white to give the perfect &#8216;I am a bit edgy&#8217; appearance. You check the price hoping it fits your budget &#8211; it does &#8211; but you also notice it says, &#8216;Material &#8211; 100% Jellyfish’. Would you still buy it?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past decade, we have seen biosynthetic meat appear on supermarket shelves and environmentally conscious eating become on-trend. Yet, despite textile manufacturing also creating tremendous amounts of waste and planetary destruction, fashion has failed to catch up with this shift. Price and garment quality continue to decline. New collections appear infinite. We are buying more than ever and yet keeping our garments for less time. Around £30 billion worth of clothes hang unscathed in our closets and, in the UK, those that are used survive an average of only 2.2 years before we reject them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The State of Fashion 2020&#8221; (Business of Fashion &amp; McKinsey) reports a dramatic shift in mindset, indicating that a global transformation of the fashion industry is starting. Fashion, technology and biology are converging to create new eco-fibres and sustainable production techniques &#8211; hoping they can scrape fashion into a greener future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jellyfish have caught the eye of designers due to their potential as a replacement for leather. Although granted &#8216;staple status&#8217;, leather undeniably has negative impacts on both our planet and people. The rearing of livestock is to blame for almost 15% human-induced CO2 emissions and an estimated 80% of deforestation worldwide. To convert an animal hide into leather, it must undergo a tanning process – a process that 90% of the time uses the toxic chemical Chromium. Its exposure has been linked with health issues, subjecting tanning factory workers to skin infections and respiratory difficulties.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;A blend of global warming and overfishing has caused jellyfish to overpopulate, resulting in disruption beyond closing popular swimming spots. In 1999, they made 40 million people in the Philippines powerless by clogging their chief power plant. In 2013, they blocked the cooling filters of Sweden&#8217;s Oskarshamn nuclear plant, causing it to shut down. This is not an isolated case. The disturbance occurred two years earlier at Scotland&#8217;s Torness nuclear power plant. Once washed, salted and dried, these creatures can be cut and sewn much like leather but eliminating leather-associated pollution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Synthetic fibres (materials created via chemical processing) have achieved fame due to their ability to be mass-produced. They are cheap but many plastic-based, meaning that when discarded, they live on for billions of years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong>What if clothes could have a life beyond your wardrobe?</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Innovative scientists at Bolt Threads and MycoWorks have explored this idea, creating a mushroom-based fabric called Mycelium. Though alien-sounding and a little bit gross, these fungi spores can be grown anywhere with minimal amounts of water to form clothing pieces without the need for sewing or altering. Once used, this material decomposes, releasing digestive enzymes and restoring nutrients back to the earth. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"428\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/clint-patterson-Nb-BGK92UW8-unsplash-scaled.jpg?resize=640%2C428&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1187\" data-full-url=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/clint-patterson-Nb-BGK92UW8-unsplash-scaled.jpg?resize=640%2C428&#038;ssl=1\" data-link=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/would-you-wear-a-jellyfish/clint-patterson-nb-bgk92uw8-unsplash/\" class=\"wp-image-1187\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/clint-patterson-Nb-BGK92UW8-unsplash-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/clint-patterson-Nb-BGK92UW8-unsplash-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/clint-patterson-Nb-BGK92UW8-unsplash-scaled.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/clint-patterson-Nb-BGK92UW8-unsplash-scaled.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"621\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image3-2-e1589876617634.png?resize=640%2C621&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1181\" data-full-url=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image3-2-e1589876617634.png?resize=640%2C621&#038;ssl=1\" data-link=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/would-you-wear-a-jellyfish/image3-2/\" class=\"wp-image-1181\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image3-2-e1589876617634.png?w=654&amp;ssl=1 654w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image3-2-e1589876617634.png?resize=300%2C291&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Jellyfish and Mycelium are only the beginning. Stella McCartney has explored the use of Micro-silk to fashion dresses; silk produced by genetically modified yeast cells. Despite its biodegradable nature, silk production involves exterminating billions of worms and has received concerns about inhumane child labour.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, H&amp;M launched cowboy boots and a leather jacket composed of pineapple leather. Eco-friendly fibres have also been made from: algae, loti and cacti, remodelling fashion into something out of a sci-fi movie. With substantial technological advancements cheapening their use, we may find these materials become mainstream and available in affordable stores. But is this what we, as consumers, really want?</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong>Do we need to wear coats made from jellyfish?</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Fashion is inherently unsustainable, and this is becoming more commonly recognised. Over the last three years, the second-hand garments market has grown 21 times faster than the regular retail market. Thrift shopping is not only now trendy but becoming the new norm. Yet, although this behaviour appears sustainable, it is still a capitalistic activity focused primarily on sales. As the famous trendwatcher, Lidewij Edelkoor asserts:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;The system is seriously ill. Seriously, seriously ill. The overconsumption is leading to neglect, and there is no fantasy about fashion anymore, because we don&#8217;t give enough care to the making of clothes.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding new methods of consumption could act as a remedy for this sickness, such as renting garments instead of owning them or marketing the importance of having less. Unfortunately, human behaviour is difficult to change.

        "content": "\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8216;The Last Dance&#8217;, a 10-part documentary series broadcast by ESPN and Netflix, merely exists to enhance the legacy of 6-time NBA Champion Michael Jordan, and his team, the Chicago Bulls. And what a legacy it is. My immediate conclusion upon finishing the series was that surely this Bulls team is the greatest ever, in any sport, and that Michael Jordan is certainly the greatest athlete of all time. In the absence of live sport, it is essential viewing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The series, directed by Jason Hehir, is excellently curated utilising a wealth of previously unseen archive footage, a superb and relevant soundtrack, and influential figures a plenty (including two recent presidents). The message consistently reinforced is that &#8216;winning is everything&#8217;, and if you look as good as Michael Jordan and the rest of the Chicago Bulls when doing it, then hats off to you. &#8216;The Last Dance’ takes the viewer on a timeline from Jordan’s childhood through to his final championship in 1998, never settling in one place for too long, with various subplots and twists and turns along the way. Despite Dennis Rodman’s outrageous ‘extra-curricular’ activities, Scottie Pippen’s development into one of the most effective players in the NBA, or Phil Jackson’s admirable holistic coaching philosophy, Michael Jordan is fittingly the star of the show as he so often was on the court.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The documentary is built around Jordan being consulted on every storyline, often aided by a whiskey and, to his credit, he is frank and open to discussion around a plethora of issues. Having understandably preferred to remain out of the public eye since his third and final retirement from basketball in 2003, it is delightful to hear from the man who was undoubtedly the driving force behind that record-breaking Chicago Bulls team, and the NBA’s global expansion, as he discusses in detail his life’s work. The show leaves us with the idea that Jordan is the ultimate competitor, a man who thrived on the biggest of stages, pushed his team mates to be the greatest they could be, and motivated himself with personal clashes, genuine or imagined. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are also shown that, despite the divine status bestowed upon him by his millions of fans, Jordan is in fact human and much like the rest of us, is not perfect. He has dealt with his fair share of personal traumas and is not always the polished embodiment of the ‘American Dream’. We are exposed to the grief and raw emotion he felt when his father was tragically murdered in 1993 – the event which led him to retire for the first time &#8211; and his unbearable and excessive competitiveness (on separate occasions compulsively punching two of his teammates in training). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>His gambling habits, considered by some to be his ‘vice’, are also scrutinised. One can formulate an individual opinion as to whether or not his gambling, which often played out on the golf course with “friends”, warranted the media frenzy it created at the time. The shady relationship and payments made by him to convicted felon Slim Bouler, and the outlandish claims by Richard Esquinas that Jordan owed him $1.2million as a result of numerous lost golf bets certainly spark interest, and in some corners concern, as Jordan seemed to be gambling with his reputation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the bigger picture needs to be considered. In reality, Jordan’s golfing ability was not relative to his wagers, nor did these actions damage him financially. Instead, they happened because he had acquired ludicrous riches through unprecedented and continued commercial success through his sneaker endorsement deals and the NBA. The much bigger issue in all of this was, and still is, Jordan’s problems with “competition”, something he admitted in an interview in 1993 with Ahmad Rashad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The foundations of his obsession are rooted deep within his childhood, when he incessantly battled against his brother Larry for their father’s attention. Jordan’s decision to cover up the Reebok logo on his USA tracksuit by draping an American flag over his shoulders at the 1992 Olympics medal ceremony, honouring his long-standing partnership with Nike, is another representation of this. On this occasion, as throughout his life, Jordan refuses to attach the Jordan brand to the losing side or one he is not deeply committed to. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The man simply does not accept defeat, be that selling apparel and sneakers alongside Nike through his globally iconic ‘Air Jordan’ brand, or on the court with the Chicago Bulls. That unrelenting competitive edge typifies Jordan and is ultimately why this documentary resonates, to reaffirm and enhance the Jordan legacy in the modern era.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image2.jpeg?resize=640%2C427&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1202\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image2.jpeg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image2.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image2.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image2.jpeg?resize=693%2C462&amp;ssl=1 693w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image2.jpeg?resize=150%2C100&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><em>The &#8216;Air Jordan&#8217; brand was established in 198</em>4</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout his life, whenever faced with failure or criticism, Jordan responded emphatically by putting on a show for all concerned. Whether it be the endless practice over his sophomore summer after not being selected for his high school team, the desire to drive himself and his teammates on to maximise their potential and defeat their fiercest rivals the Detroit Pistons, or to come out of retirement and take the Bulls to a second 3-peat, Michael Jordan always performed for the masses. In ‘The Last Dance’ he does exactly that. His job now is a little easier, he merely has to recount tales of his greatness to a new generation who ponder the question, “who is the greatest basketball player of all time?” and to remind anyone foolish enough to have forgotten. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Alex Bidwell </em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/alexbidwell/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a7f1b45e03601ead302a263c611faba6?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Alex Bidwell\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/alexbidwell/\">Alex Bidwell</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Of course, this can prove difficult given the restrictions to both our physical and social freedoms, but I would like to offer some advice on how to manage stress from your own home. In fact, your own shower.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-16-at-16.14.20-2.png?fit=640%2C1018&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1141\" width=\"257\" height=\"393\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-16-at-16.14.20-2.png?zoom=2&amp;resize=257%2C393&amp;ssl=1 514w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-16-at-16.14.20-2.png?zoom=3&amp;resize=257%2C393&amp;ssl=1 771w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I set up Chilly Dippers just over a year ago now as a mental health initiative aimed at introducing natural coping mechanisms to help combat everyday stresses and anxieties. For so long I have enjoyed cold-water swimming and have felt its first-hand benefits to my mental health as I plunge into the icy cold!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been lucky enough to persuade lots of students in joining me to strip off into their finest swimming frocks and run in to the sea / rivers / lidos, all to raise awareness for the improvements it can have on one’s own state of health. Although it may not sound like the most attractive thing to be doing, there is a wealth of scientific evidence to prove just how much the body and brain react to help you enjoy that icy kick. Given we are not all able to use the sea so frequently, you can get the same cold-water benefits from changing your shower temperature to freezing for the very last 30 seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong><em>Physical Benefits:</em></strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The cold shock forces your blood cells to surface, helping to warm extremities and adapt us to the cold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It boosts your immune system through increasing your white blood cell count, as your body is forced to react to the changing conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;It gives you a natural high with its release of Endorphins &amp; Adrenaline.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong><em>Mental Benefits:</em></strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a great way to reduce stress&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;When you are submerged in cold water, your body is thrown into “fight-or-flight” mode. In this case, all external stresses and everyday panics are suppressed by the thought of how to manage this cold situation, right here, right now. The cold captivates you completely and, in this sense, offers perspective on any other problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a great opportunity to regulate your breathing to help you cope in a situation of stress; focusing on a deeper inhale and exhale.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong><em>Energy:</em></strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>It offers a chance to push yourself in a totally different environment. Once you leave the water (with a warm towel and cup of tea), you will look back at what you have just done with a great sense of achievement. It will leave you feeling on Cloud Nine once you&#8217;ve accomplished it.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1870\" height=\"1232\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-16-at-16.13.23.png?fit=640%2C422&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1146\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-16-at-16.13.23.png?w=1870&amp;ssl=1 1870w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-16-at-16.13.23.png?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-16-at-16.13.23.png?resize=1024%2C675&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-16-at-16.13.23.png?resize=768%2C506&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-16-at-16.13.23.png?resize=1536%2C1012&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-16-at-16.13.23.png?resize=150%2C100&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-16-at-16.13.23.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Since starting Chilly Dippers, I’ve been lucky enough to persuade people to take the plunge with me in Edinburgh’s Portobello Beach as well as The Serpentine Lido. It’s been fantastic seeing how people are willing to open up to each other (and total strangers) about their personal experiences with mental health, and how sports &amp; nature provide similar resources of refuge to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With obvious restrictions prohibiting The Chilly Dippers meet-ups in the last few weeks, I have started ‘The Chilly Dippers Challenge’. A challenge in which you get on your favourite swimmers, hop in a freezing cold shower and really try to focus on your breathing to feel the benefits for yourself. There are no COVID restrictions on a cold shower! Once you’ve done this, your endorphin levels should be flying, and now you can tag x3 friends to do the same. A proper set up for your day ahead!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-16-at-16.22.42-1.png?resize=640%2C645&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1145\" data-full-url=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-16-at-16.22.42-1.png?fit=962%2C970&amp;ssl=1\" data-link=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/?attachment_id=1145\" class=\"wp-image-1145\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-16-at-16.22.42-1.png?w=962&amp;ssl=1 962w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-16-at-16.22.42-1.png?resize=298%2C300&amp;ssl=1 298w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-16-at-16.22.42-1.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-16-at-16.22.42-1.png?resize=768%2C774&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"605\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-16-at-16.22.18-1.png?resize=640%2C605&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1144\" data-full-url=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-16-at-16.22.18-1.png?fit=982%2C928&amp;ssl=1\" data-link=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/?attachment_id=1144\" class=\"wp-image-1144\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-16-at-16.22.18-1.png?w=982&amp;ssl=1 982w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-16-at-16.22.18-1.png?resize=300%2C284&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-16-at-16.22.18-1.png?resize=768%2C726&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow Chilly Dippers on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chilly.dippers/\"><strong><em>Instagram</em></strong></a> or find them on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/chilly.dippers1/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Facebook</strong></em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Olivia Sharron</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211;

The Summer. The potential to go abroad, to festivals, parties and weddings &#8211; all the while making merry with your pals late into the night. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wrong. Due to unforeseen circumstances it would appear that the 2020 summer social calendar has been written off. Especially if you’re a schoolchild, whose immediate future plans of unfettered Fortnite have been snatched away in lieu of imminent transportation back to school.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;A small price to pay for the sweet release from our pink scaly complexion&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>However, summer still remains a glorious time where we can remove the woolly jumpers, recline outside and ionise our skin cells to our hearts’ content. A small price to pay for the sweet release from our pink scaly complexion. But sunning yourself on the local patch, daydreaming about plans for 2021 just won’t do. We must live in the here and now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, get your hands on a newspaper and for God’s sake get your head out of the business section (you furloughed ferret). Instead, turn yourself over to the often-abandoned-cum-barbecue-starter that is the Travel section. Here you will find a wealth of ideas to inspire your incubated, dwindling horizons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Safe-escapes are in. Yurts, treehouses and shepherd’s huts are all making a resurgence thanks to the joys of self check-in. Now you can create your own cocoon of womb-like tranquillity under a canopy of stars, surrounded by the infinite expanses of the greatly-missed great outdoors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apparently, the United Kingdom is home to 15 jaw-droppingly attractive National Parks. These are equally dispersed throughout the land so that everyone gets a go. By visiting the Lake District, Dartmoor or The Broads, you can actually consent to having your breath taken away this summer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"580\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image2.gif?resize=500%2C580&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1132\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption><em>The UK is home to 15 National Parks</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Infected Britain is placed pretty high on the naughty list of global travel destinations this year. Those rare, daring travellers who continue to select the United Kingdom as their vacation destination will be treated to world-famous British hospitality upon arrival. 14 days of forced isolation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This provides a wealth of opportunity for those already stuck on the island. You can explore the sights unencumbered by the crowds of flashing tourists! Beaches might be a tough sell. Batting away social-distancing transgressors with a lengthy ruler isn’t that relaxing. The restriction riddled museums won’t do either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, why not undertake your very own landmark tour of Britain. See if Stonehenge, Durdle Door and Hadrian’s Wall look any different from the postcards. Who knows, you might even be able to filch a few rocks as a souvenir.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the hotels remain closed and you’re struggling for places to stay, impose on any family you have dotted around the place.

The 40% reduction in funding has attracted vitriol from what appeared to be the entire rugby community – with the rugby <em>Twitterati</em> leading the charge. But with the professional game itself in financial peril around the world (not just domestically), was it ever realistic for the ruling body to sustain a league with a current average attendance of 1,604 per match?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A little over a week after the cuts were announced and ostensibly in response to media clamour surrounding the original announcement, England Rugby’s CEO, Bill Sweeney, announced a revised timeframe of 2 years to its Championship cuts. While this response was welcomed in some corners of the media, Sweeney’s move strikes me as a mere extension of notice period and a slightly better severance pay package; the outcome will be the same. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a counter issued in <em>The Rugby Paper</em>, responding to an open letter shared&nbsp;by the Championship Clubs Committee expressing concerns at the cuts, Sweeney finally lifted the lid and shared his rationale behind the cuts. From which, a key point stood out in a piece otherwise devoid of empathy:<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“I do need to go back to 2015 when the decision was taken to increase the funding by 100%. That was done basically against five principles that were put to our Board as to why we would increase it. The first element was to establish a financially sustainable second tier of the game. The average loss per club is £260k, so that one has not been achieved for whatever reason”.</em></p><cite>England Rugby CEO, Bill Sweeney.</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to this, it was also highlighted in England Rugby’s latest annual report that there had been a 7% reduction in investment across the professional game, and a 6% drop at community level, with accounts showing a decline to £100.5m and projected to fall to £95m in the next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, the situation could hardly be more dire and reached parody during the Rugby World Cup when it was revealed England winning the Webb Ellis trophy would have seen the ‘skint’ RFU pay players and management a £6m bonus, which in doing so could have quite easily brought the liquidators in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, and at the risk of sounding like a moronic, deliberately-contrarian Good Morning Britain presenter, could this in fact be the most modern thing the ‘Old Boys Club’ has done in recent years, a move to save the game from complete collapse?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In all seriousness, if the Premiership is ring-fenced and funding is redistributed upwards, that could be the catalyst and beginning of rugby and the Premiership being brought to the forefront of modern-day sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Increased salaries, improved facilities, and greater investor confidence with the threat of relegation removed. Such an injection of capital could boost professionalism, improve playing standards and eradicate the elements of amateurism that still exist at the top, charming as they might be. And, in essence, we could potentially see the dawn of a franchise league somewhat reminiscent of our North American sporting counterparts, who have seen excellent sporting and financial success through their system of involving both a national and develop league system (NBA &amp; NBA G League, Major League Baseball &amp; Minor League Baseball etc.).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the counter arguments are there: What about ambitious Championship clubs like the Cornish Pirates, Coventry and Ealing Trailfinders in this new ring-fenced league? What about the young players of competitive rugby who will miss out on a professional second tier league?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, they are questions that need to be answered. Though, as a sport, rugby needs to move in a more sustainable direction because the trajectory that we were on was to oblivion. And while advocating for the cuts is certainly a painful position to adopt (especially as someone who valued their brief stint in the league during my former career), for a place that has proved itself highly successful in breeding stars of the future, to carry on as if nothing is wrong, would be fatal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just over 20 years after its move to professionalism, rugby is now a business at a crossroads, mismanage it and we could reverse some of the great strides that have already been made.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Conor Dolan</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/conordolan/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9cc60a2392c86a721faa713b7500abbc?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Conor Dolan\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/conordolan/\">Conor Dolan</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

While 79% of 12-34 year olds were Facebook users in 2017, this number was down to 62% in 2019. Edison Research, having asked Facebook users why they use the platform less, pointed to the unattractive environment of negativity, political rants and Mark Zuckerberg’s harvesting of data. This should not be misunderstood as disengagement with socio-political issues. As Facebook falls, new players rise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At risk of stating the glaringly obvious: young people care. September 2019 saw the largest climate protest in history. It was organised by 16 year old Greta Thunberg and populated by millions of teenagers around the world. They just do not want to discuss such issues in the Facebook echo-chamber, locking horns with their mildly-racist second cousin who’s hell bent on being the UK’s #1 fake news super-spreader.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are three examples of the new Gen Z battlefields:</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>TikTok</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The wildly popular video sharing app (800m active users), famous for its silly dance sketches, has become an unconventional arena for political debate. In February 2020, a 20-second TikTok video of a teenage girl getting an abortion went viral. Set to Bruno Mars’ “It Will Rain”, the experience is shared with the casual tone of teenage silliness. The debate blew up. Pro-life users thought the video to be a “sick &amp; depraved” reflection of “the left’, while pro-choice users praised the video’s honesty. At the time of writing #abortion has 119m views. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/11-1.png?resize=482%2C504&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1096\" width=\"482\" height=\"504\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h5>Twitch</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The home of live stream gamers. Twitch’s 15m daily active users have also experienced the encroachment of politics in its own way. Trihex is a professional gamer that creates content on Twitch, live streaming to his 425k followers. An African-American man from Florida, Trihex is a vocal supporter of Bernie Sanders (who has a verified Twitch account @bernie_sanders). In March 2020, Trihex streamed the US Democratic Bernie vs Biden debate. Mixing Super Smash Bros with political commentary, Trihex’s loyalties were laid bare, pleading Biden to stop with “these f****** lies dude”.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"420\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image2-2-1.png?resize=640%2C420&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1114\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image2-2-1.png?w=818&amp;ssl=1 818w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image2-2-1.png?resize=300%2C197&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image2-2-1.png?resize=768%2C504&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In another incident, while Trihex was live streaming, one of his followers gifted a paid subscription to the Trihex live feed to the @bernie_sanders account. It seemed as though Bernie has subscribed himself. Shared widely amongst the gaming community, Bernie’s first gameplay stream is eagerly awaited. </p>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong>YurOn</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image3-1.png?resize=233%2C334&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1094\" width=\"233\" height=\"334\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image3-1.png?zoom=2&amp;resize=233%2C334&amp;ssl=1 466w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image3-1.png?zoom=3&amp;resize=233%2C334&amp;ssl=1 699w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A smaller platform than the TikToks or Twitches of this world. YurOn is a video sharing app, whose USP is its conversation thread (released on the App Store April 2020). Full disclosure, I know the app well as I’m part of the team building it. We’ve seen 13 year olds share what they’re doing for the climate in 2020 and 18 year olds play around with yoga for mental health awareness. Here is a photo of myself trying to show our Gen Z users how woke I am. You can almost hear them cringing through their screens as they move the conversation onto biodegradable poo bags and the perils of plastic waste. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gen Z social media natives want to address meaningful issues, but they just don’t want to address them in a stale environment. Facebook has become that stale environment and is paying the price losing users to the TikToks, Twitchs and YurOns of this world. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Hamish Richardson</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/hamishrichardson/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/638d83a5916040f881d70cd7839c76ee?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Hamish Richardson\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/hamishrichardson/\">Hamish Richardson</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

The relinquishment of Hong Kong in 1991 and the end of the British Raj in South Asia in 1947 are often cited as the legal and territorial bases for the end of the Empire but, in spirit, it is the Suez Crisis in 1956 which truly stripped Britain of its superpower status; <em><strong><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=MYs-8OMk_H0C&amp;pg=PA212\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">redefining it</a> </strong></em>merely as one of many strong European states instead of the global leader and decision maker it once was.<sup> </sup> Today we find ourselves witness to a new Suez Crisis. As the United States is seemingly absent without leave in co-ordinating an international response to the virus, China leaps to the aid of a multitude of countries &#8211; from Italy to Ethiopia &#8211; in an unprecedented engagement with the international community as the West deals with its own massive outbreaks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many parallels with the Trump administration’s current mismanagement of coronavirus. Buoyed by a vocal and committed minority of voters, the President has pursued a course which has brought the US a huge amount of international and diplomatic pressure – but this time, it’s different. America’s position in the global order is under threat. The Ebola outbreak in 2014 saw a huge American-led international response and a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-29262968\" target=\"_blank\">UN Resolution</a></em></strong></span> backed with cash passed within a month. In contrast, there is no international response at all to the coronavirus. The Trump administration – bound by the nuances of American politics and by its ever clearer “America First” agenda – has floundered in response to the pandemic and, as states continue to take diametrically opposed stances on lockdowns, China has eagerly seized the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though SARS-CoV-2 originated in China, it has sought to portray itself as the world’s saviour in this hour of need; a capable, strong alternative to an increasingly out of touch Washington. China is well known to tightly control information, from its imprisonment and indoctrination of the <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-china-concentrationcamps/china-putting-minority-muslims-in-concentration-camps-u-s-says-idUKKCN1S925F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><em>Uyghurs</em></strong></a> to its clampdown on <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-latest-china-disinformation-facebook-twitter-social-media-a9071046.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><em>Hong Kong</em></strong></a>. Most readers of this article will be aware that China has fabricated its case and death statistics – it is painfully apparent when you compare them to more transparent countries such as Italy – but there are questions about their actions that go beyond the staple lack of transparency we have all come to expect from the Communist Party. While Wuhan was quarantined and internal travel within China banned, Chinese officials complained about foreign bans, and actively <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/Whathappensif/how-china-locked-down-internally-for-covid-19-but-pushed-foreign-travel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><em>e</em></strong></a><strong><em><a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/Whathappensif/how-china-locked-down-internally-for-covid-19-but-pushed-foreign-travel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ncouraged foreign travel</a>.</em></strong> While traffic between Chinese cities was suppressed below 10%, the party cried racism in response to the Trump administration’s travel ban and criticised other governments for following suit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of its other measures have had a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/chinas-bid-to-repair-its-coronavirus-hit-image-is-backfiring-in-the-west/2020/04/14/8611bbba-7978-11ea-a311-adb1344719a9_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><em>mixed reception</em></strong></a>. Medical aid dispatched to most of Europe has been rejected either partially or outright due to concerns over safety. Even in Turkey, who have themselves <strong><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/all-400000-gowns-flown-from-turkey-for-nhs-fail-uk-standards\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sent faulty gowns</a></em></strong> to us, there have been <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52092395\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><em>concerns about Chinese equipment</em></strong></a>. In Africa, countries that, by their own admission, are desperate for supply of any kind see Chinese aid with <strong><em><a href=\"https://qz.com/africa/1834670/chinese-medical-aid-for-covid-19-in-africa-gets-mixed-support/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">suspicion</a></em></strong>. The contrasts between this and the kind of genuine humanitarian assistance which was supplied to tackle Ebola are clear; Chinese help is rarely in good faith and comes with strings attached.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere however, Beijing has made progress. China has successfully coerced the European Union into <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/china-has-turned-to-bullying-to-avoid-accountability-it-may-be-working-on-europe/2020/04/30/30be39c2-8977-11ea-9dfd-990f9dcc71fc_story.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>censoring its own reports</em></strong></a> on Chinese disinformation. Italy, which in 2019 opted into China’s famous <strong><em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/world/europe/italy-one-belt-one-road-china.html\" target=\"_blank\">Belt and Road</a></em></strong> Initiative, has become the focal point of Chinese influence and disinformation in Europe. In Italy, prominent media figures and key officials are beginning to recite a suspicious narrative that China is Italy’s <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2020/03/china-italy-and-coronavirus-geopolitics-and-propaganda/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>closest friend</em></strong></a>. And as for Germany, France, or Brussels? They are the enemy and have abandoned Italy. Beijing was quick to send aid to Italy – most of it faulty, and even some donated by the Italians themselves during January’s outbreak in Wuhan. Yet, despite these uncomfortable truths Beijing seems to be winning the <strong><em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/31/china-isnt-helping-italy-its-waging-information-warfare/\" target=\"_blank\">information war</a></em></strong> in Europe’s 4<sup>th</sup> Largest Economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This influence over Europe has paid off in spades. As the Trump administration begins to form its own narrative over China’s actions, it is finding itself surprisingly alone. Europe is distracted by predictable arguments over fiscal policy and seems more interested in criticising America’s response to the virus than anything to do with its source nation. Even a <a href=\"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/coronavirus/bombshell-dossier-lays-out-case-against-chinese-bat-virus-program/news-story/55add857058731c9c71c0e96ad17da60\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><em>Five Eyes Dossier</em></strong></a> outlining China’s conduct has seen infighting among traditional Western Allies. Take Australia, for example, who initially seemed to support the dossier in question but then <strong><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/australia-hits-back-at-us-claim-linking-coronavirus-to-wuhan-lab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">walked back</a></em></strong>, in an attempt to stay somewhat neutral.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That Australia, one of America’s most fastidious allies, is facing this dilemma should give analysts around the world pause. Covid-19 may come to pass as a watershed moment in the Rise of China, a country which will remain in our headlines long after this is over. When we establish our ‘new normal’ – whatever that will be – China’s overshadowing of the United States will be a part it, and we will enter a multipolar world with competing axes of global power, reminiscent of the Cold War. The USSR however, even at its mightiest, was <strong><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_largest_historical_GDP\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">only half </a></em></strong>as wealthy as the US.

Like any new relationship, it cooks up a stew of so many different emotions. Like any new relationship, it should also be understood as a journey. Moving from strangers to hostile room-mates, I have consistently judged my emotions towards the virus. There seems to be an invisible benchmark to how I <em>should</em> be feeling. But really, the only consistent fact we know about COVID-19 is that it is inconsistent. It is multi-faceted and, like any new relationship it should be approached with an open-mind and the gentle understanding that it casts a dynamic spectrum of emotions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><em><strong>The Drama</strong></em></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Wrapped up in our everyday schedules COVID-19 stealthily crept into our media and conversation, like a cold breeze prickling our wrists and ankles. As chills turn into strong winds, strong winds into cyclones and cyclones into christened Storms, the growing proximity of the virus led to its inflated online profile of Corona.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until we have, live with, or care for someone who has COVID-19, <em>it is</em> an abstraction. When something is largely unknown it harvests extreme emotions. Watching the news, we are repulsed but tempted; laughing and crying at the same time. This tension hammers our feet into the ground, stuck between running away and towards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is no secret that the success of most horror films lies in their use of anticipation. Before a shadow is excused by a coat or a sound confirms that someone is in the house, the protagonist freezes and the music is turned up to simulate their heightened senses. What comes next is entirely different. For many, COVID-19 is this shapeless villain. Working in a school I watched and listened as it took on different forms in the lead up to school closures. When the doors to the school did shut I opened my laptop every morning in search of words and images to capture it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My parents chose to lockdown their care home in February. The weeks that followed were enveloped in an eerie silence. Although within the walls the loving and caring atmosphere continued, the closed door was a mark of separation, a sign of an invisible threat. Waiting at the crossroad, staff and family were unsettled. They were also naturally and caringly curious. Talk of the virus bounced off the walls.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This COVID-19</strong> is frightening but it is also captivating. Our fears are not confirmed nor is our safety guaranteed. The <a href=\"https://iai.tv/articles/the-attraction-of-apocalypse-auid-1394\">‘attraction of the apocalypse’</a> Stephen De Wijze writes, is the natural human interest in evil and suffering; but only, he stresses, ‘when we feel it is safe’. When we are watching from behind a screen we still have the option of turning off the television set and strolling back to the fridge. The government instruction to ‘STAY HOME’ has unwittingly created a home-cinema experience, and if Charlie Brooker’s ‘Bandersnatch’ ignited a craze of interactive film, the online life of COVID-19 is a sick prequel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the digital floodgates now open, the stream of daily updates, conspiracy theories and memes flood our personal and professional spaces. We have, where we can, attempted to turn the taps and adjust the temperature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meeting the virus online we had no idea what it looked like in person. <em>It is</em> natural to be intrigued, especially when their profile has over fifty million hits a day. Acknowledging this and recognising you do have an element of control here is not criminal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><em>The Embodied</em></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The lived reality of a horror film is strikingly different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My parents’ nursing home has a fundamental ethos of emotionally led support, one which inherently relies on the connection of people. These connections have been compromised daily by PPE (how does someone living with dementia process a mask?) and the stark reality that this virus kills – in the period of a week five people, who had previously been healthy, died. Dividing people, sectioning off communal spaces and moving towards task-orientated work strikes a different chord of loneliness to that of the type experienced when watching a rom-com or sitting staring out of the back window of a car with sad music on. This is the part that the film skims over. <strong>This COVID-19</strong> is horrific.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><em>The Daily</em></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many others, COVID-19 is now in my home. My parents both tested positive, one asymptomatic and the other living through a very unglamorous experience of flu-like symptoms. This version of COVID-19 is neither triumphantly harmless nor (thankfully) life-threatening. I had that flat feeling like when you meet a celebrity or take your headphones off at a silent disco: slightly embarrassed by my expectations and a bit sore and irritable from the grounding. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This</strong><strong> COVID-19</strong> is not spikey or soft, it is a bit bumpy and awkward. In the room it can be forgotten about. I can feel upset and moved by its frailty whilst also being frustrated at its clumsiness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><em>So?</em></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>I was annoyed at myself when I didn’t feel the right way. My intentions felt misguided when I listened and fed the sensationalism, my grief robbed when I found out a man I had known all my life had suddenly died overnight and then my sympathy inadequate when my dad was unwell. I was constantly holding up how I was feeling to how I <em>should</em> be feeling. I still am.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Demanding emotions and writing linearity into our relationships destroys them. We all know we need to be curious and open when we first meet someone new. That doesn’t mean the fear, disappointment, excitement, or upset will go but rather that we lean into them and accept them as part of the process – not getting annoyed at them because they weren’t part of the plan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>COVID-19 has shown me how naturally we reach for stories when we are scared and anxious about meeting something new for the first time. But it has also shown me how harmful this can be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who know me will know that I would not exactly be shaken by the prospect of self-isolation. However, this period has emphasised the daily tightrope we <em>all</em> walk. It is dangerous and uncontrollable out there and we, naturally, use our stories as harnesses. Eclipsing (uncannily) with the wellbeing phase, this period is truly invaluable to reconnect with ourselves and tighten the straps for when we next ‘walk the plank’. BUT, stories can stop us from experiencing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><em>So</em>, I think I understand a bit better now.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>COVID-19 has taken on different shapes for different people, depending on their experience and story. I wrote this to understand my relationship with COVID-19 and in the process found fixed narratives and expectations I was holding; that I think maybe a few of us will be holding. Writing them on the page let me see how much was out of my control and in the process be kinder and more accepting of the different emotions. I feel grateful that I have had the time and space to clarify this. I would encourage anyone else who is feeling distressed or uncomfortable to do the same – it’s frightening putting something out there but then, when seen as separate to ourselves we, incongruously, offer more kindness and acceptance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Bronte Heath </em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/bronteheath/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1746d840edf0efe4a0b9833b9cd62a3d?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Bronte Heath\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/bronteheath/\">Bronte Heath</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

It may seem a distant memory as days have blown into weeks and soon months under lockdown. But back in February, half a million people were without power, weather warnings clouded the UK forecasts and 13 fatalities were to be recorded. Boris hastily packed his bags to dash to Kent (a quaint 115-room Grade II-listed mansion getaway) before Ciara’s nasty brother Dennis arrived. Cobra meetings, flood warnings, health warnings&#8230; talk about a storm in a teacup, but this was the burden of being born to rule and such nonsense would plague him unless he lay low for a few days. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Somehow, amidst the wintry gusts and violent downpours, my first competitive tennis match since life-changing surgery was still going ahead. Before ‘life-changing surgery’ goes setting any wild imaginations into motion, no, I didn’t have anything enlarged or reduced, or a sex change, or anything at all glamorous. I’d had my large intestine removed, because I was ill with Ulcerative Colitis and, frankly, it was killing me. But now I was better and raring to compete. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wind roared and rain poured and I was soaked just running from my car to the dome-bubble under which the match was to be played. I’d heard of these winter domes collapsing and blowing away, but Google told me they were resistant to 150mph winds and Ciara was a benign sneeze (when sneezes&nbsp;<em>could</em>&nbsp;be benign pre-coronavirus) in comparison with that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mid-way through the first set, my small intestine started falling out of my stomach. If this conjures images of the legendary&nbsp;<em>Alien</em>&nbsp;chestburster scene, you’re not too far from the truth. In fact, that scene was inspired by the screenwriter’s experience of Crohn’s disease, a similarly debilitating digestive disorder. Let me explain. With no remaining large intestine, I have a stoma bag. Put simply, the end of my small intestine pokes out of an opening in my abdominal muscles and a bag collects what it needs to collect. The surgery split my stomach in two places and I have to take care to protect it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naively, I wasn’t wearing a hernia belt for the match. Tennis players twist and turn as often as Storm Ciara’s tornado cousins, and a hernia belt fits as restrictively as a corset. So, I chose not to wear it. However, without the belt, there was nothing to hold everything in place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After conceding the first set, I informed my doubles partner and our opponents of my predicament. I went to the toilet and waited for my small intestine to recede. This had happened once before, in a rather more intimate moment where a hernia belt was also absent. That time it had quickly returned to it’s usual strawberry-sized protrusion from my stomach surface. This time, I had no such luck. I uneasily strapped the belt around my bag and my outside-insides and got on with the match.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Free from any performance expectation, my tennis strokes started swinging as loosely as my intestines in the second set and we soon found ourselves racing into a lead. The only game we couldn’t win was when the burly bloke in the opposite pair was serving. It didn’t help that he foot-faulted every time, taking a whole step over the line before repeatedly throwing down aces.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foot-faulting is tennis’ equivalent of what diving is to football: cheating that culprits deny is cheating. I decided to ask burly if he’d mind serving from behind the line. Unfortunately, no-one had warned me that burly also had a reputation for being explosively aggressive and I soon realised everything preceding this fateful moment had taken place in eye of the storm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the blurred cyclone of the next hour I was called every obscenity under the faraway sun and had smashes rocketed at me from point-blank range (only one was accurate and he missed my stoma, luckily). If it wasn’t for one of my teammates jumping in when burly stormed to my side of the night, spitting with fury centimetres from my face, I might have been lamped a right-hook as burly channelled his inner Tyson. With pathetic fallacy befitting the drama, Ciara intensified and the bubble stretched and strained at the hinges, bending to extreme angles. And the noise! The water beat so vociferously you couldn’t hear the ball make contact with the strings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was shaken. I’d experienced confrontations calmly before, but the stoma took away my teenage sense of invincibility. We served for the match and I double faulted. Burly served a point for the match and I came up with a return. We won, 13-11 in the third set tie-break.&nbsp;&nbsp;My stoma returned from alien to strawberry and Ciara even calmed for the drive home. If every competitive match post-surgery (and now post-coronavirus) turns out as heart-stoppingly bonkers as the first, I think I might end up back in hospital.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By J.

Every day I wake up to a new flower blossoming in my garden. I am fortunate to have an outdoor space during this time and even luckier that my Dad spends a large proportion of his spare time outside tending the plants in our garden. Being a biologist with a father who is a doctor (and know-it-all of all things biology) he expects me to know the species and genus name of most trees and flowers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, I am ashamed to say that I struggle to distinguish between an oak and an ash (and no, Dad, just because I studied biology does not mean I should not be scared of spiders). However, I am fascinated by the vibrant pigments that nature produces. In a bid to brighten my friends’ days and share the beauty I see around me, I have picked a variety of flowers from our garden and pressed them to make cards. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I realised recently that, although I cannot resist taking a picture when I walk past a pretty flower (most of which I will most probably never look at again), I have appreciated the spring and early summer bloom so much more because I notice the daily changes in my garden. Kicking off SS20 were the daffodils, signalling that warmer days were to come. I imagine this was welcomed by most, as from my own experience, lockdown days are much better when the sun is shining &#8211; I am convinced I suffer from SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A fortnight ago, the tulips blossomed; red, pink and then yellow. This coincided with the sudden eruption of bluebells spreading throughout woods. The lonesome white bluebells standing tall amongst the most common indigo. The pretty forget-me-nots followed by the wild garlic… a smell I cannot experience without hearing my Mum say, “can you smell the wild gaaarlech”, in a strange Scouse accent. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year we decided to start foraging for garlic leaves to take advantage of the vast populations we’ve seen whilst on our daily walks. My Sister proceeded to make far too much &#8211; slightly disgusting &#8211; pesto from the abundant supply, which I’m sure will clog up our fridge for months to come. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During these daily walks, my Mum has been showing me the various ‘golden nuggets’ of our hometown. The vibrance of the beech trees astound me every time and I hope I am not alone in admiring their colours. I read some good advice recently for anyone struggling with more bad days than good, that taking a moment to appreciate just one thing in a day puts everything into perspective. For me, it is looking outside at our bird feeders whilst I eat my breakfast. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some parallels to be observed between my family and the family of blue tits that inhabit the bird house above our patio, each of us going about our relatively monotonous lives. I am rather jealous that they spend their entire lives surrounded by nature with no pressing judgement of what choices to make with their lives and careers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are only a few lessons that we can take from isolation, one is to pause and look around more often. I urge you to take in the beauty of nature that our species has inhabited for hundreds of thousands of years, something that we are rapidly being closed off from. Secondly, check in on those you care about. I know, being social creatures, this should be common among our species, but during our ‘normal’ daily lives it is all too easy to forget. Sending a card or a present can brighten the day of someone who may not be willing to admit they are struggling. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Ellie Roxburgh</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/ellieroxburgh/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d60cb2f3fabb005b602f6d953929183a?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Ellie Roxburgh\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/ellieroxburgh/\">Ellie Roxburgh</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Bush and the United States Congress rushed through a bill. Officially the bill was called the ‘<em>the Uniting and Strengthening America by </em><strong><em>P</em></strong><em>roviding </em><strong><em>A</em></strong><em>ppropriate </em><strong><em>T</em></strong><em>ools </em><strong><em>R</em></strong><em>equired to </em><strong><em>I</em></strong><em>ntercept and </em><strong><em>O</em></strong><em>bstruct </em><strong><em>T</em></strong><em>errorism Act</em>’, but it is better known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act\">Patriot Act</a>. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/6/2/8701499/patriot-act-explain\">The law</a> gave the FBI and other US Government institutions the ability to detain immigrants indefinitely; search a home or business without knowledge or consent; and to search telephone, e-mail, and financial records without a court order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of the law being passed there was very little political or public dissent. After the horrifying attacks on the World Trade Center, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/9-11-anniversary/did-patriot-act-change-us-attitudes-surveillance-n641586\">“a shocked and grieving nation demanded answers and justice”</a>. The Patriot Act was therefore passed with just one vote against in the Senate, and <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/9205/public-little-concerned-about-patriot-act.aspx\">polls even in 2003</a> (the earliest data we have) showed only 22% of the public thought the Patriot Act went “too far” in restricting Civil Liberties. It actually <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/242383-poll-most-support-surveillance-reforms\">took until 2015</a>, 14 years after the 9/11 attacks, for a majority of the American public to support changing the law.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst the law was initially meant to help the US Government deal with impending threats on the homeland, and to catch the 9/11 perpetrators, the bill actually gave <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/privacy-and-surveillance/end-mass-surveillance-under-patriot-act\"><em>carte blanche</em></a> to Cheney and Bush to spy on whoever they wanted. And then, in 2011, supposedly liberal Democratic President Obama <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/05/27/congress.patriot.act/index.html\">extended the provisions</a> originally encased in the Act that were due to expire that year. Now, in March 2020, the Trump Administration passed a <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/fisa-update/\">77-day renewa</a>l of the Act without review- which may be extended further.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what does this have to do with Coronavirus? Well, we are now seeing a very similar chain of events occur across the world in response to a very different type of attack, this being a highly infectious virus, or what Boris Johnson calls: “<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52439348\"><em>an invisible mugger</em></a>”.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to the virus, many countries are implementing the use of ‘contact-tracing apps’, which give governments the ability to track the location of citizens in order to notify them of any contact they may have had with someone who has Covid-19.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/pq3dUYMpvaPuuCyLTKmNupVMlhbIjZ5Cy1OHrYLEPHVx6DQEdtUS6fQafgHDeYZ-By6xpAjhe-e-m9kunj1cbAvgnRsD0O1YvM5tsk2lk7IgM4ZZB9fCzZphX2RQPhXXg9Ldiyxr\" alt=\"\" width=\"253\" height=\"152\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Such an approach has been used in South Korea, originally one of the major hotspots of the virus, to great effect. Whilst China achieved a quite incredible feat of locking down the virus (after the initial outbreak and government denial), their near-neighbours have achieved a similar level of success, without having to seriously restrict the movement of their citizens. The main reason for this, surveillance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, the CCTV infrastructure in place within South Korea goes far beyond anything we have in western countries. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-south-koreas-success-in-controlling-disease-is-due-to-its-acceptance-of-surveillance-134068\">In 2010</a> it was estimated that each citizen was captured on camera an average of 83 times a day, or every 9 seconds whilst travelling (with these figures likely to be much higher today). As well as this, the tracking of card payments has helped the government to track people’s movements, as South Korea has the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-south-koreas-success-in-controlling-disease-is-due-to-its-acceptance-of-surveillance-134068\">highest proportion of cashless transactions in the world</a>. Finally, South Korea also has <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-south-koreas-success-in-controlling-disease-is-due-to-its-acceptance-of-surveillance-134068\">more mobile phones than people</a>, and they have over 860,000 4G and 5G transreceivers which can trace the location of their citizens constantly-&nbsp; with mobile phone companies requiring all customers to register with their real name and address.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, combined with the testing of anyone who reports symptoms <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/trust-testing-tracing-south-korea-succeeded-us-stumbled/story?id=70433504\">within 30 minutes</a>, this enables South Korea to be able to track the spread of the virus with remarkable efficiency, to locate those who have had it and could potentially have it, and to send out alerts to anyone who may have come into contact with those infected.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although this is obviously an incredible effective tactic for tackling the virus, with South Korea recording only 250 deaths since the outbreak began, it is not without its faults. As <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00740-y\">others have highlighted</a>, the data released on public alerts includes a persons:&nbsp; “<em>last name, sex, age, district of residence, and credit-card history, with a minute-to-minute record of their comings and goings from various local businesses”, </em>with tracking often including <em>“which rooms of a building the person was in, when they visited a toilet, and whether or not they wore a mask</em>”. Casey Newton writes in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/4/10/21215267/covid-19-contact-tracing-apps-bluetooth-coronavirus-flaws-public-health\">the Verge</a> that these tracing alerts have: “<em>turned some of its citizens into imperious armchair detectives, who scour the internet in an attempt to identify people who test positive and condemn them online</em>”. Clearly there is some cost involved with such a highly efficient level of tracking and tracing procedures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent weeks, the UK has been trying to develop a track-and-trace procedure of their own. And, on Monday, a trial version of the app produced by NHSX was rolled out in the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52532435\">Isle of Wight</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UK version relies on self-reporting of symptoms/test results, which will be uploaded to the system before automatically contacting anyone whose phone was in contact with an infected person (if they also have the app).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Controversially, the UK’s app uses a ‘centralised’ form of data collection, meaning all personal details uploaded to the app are stored in a database which can be accessed by the government.&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52532435\">A recent NHSX statement</a> suggested that the centralised system will allow the government to gain more information about the virus, such as how quickly it spreads and where the hotspots are.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this approach fails to follow the <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/contact-tracing-apps-coronavirus\">strict privacy guidelines</a> which companies like Apple and Google laid out in their initial discussion of a ‘<em>decentralised</em>’ app which only stores personal data on individual phones. Germany has already <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-28/coronavirus-covid19-contact-tracing-apps-around-the-world/12189438\">rolled back its plan</a> to launch a contact-tracing app due to concerns over a centralised database affecting the privacy of users .&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is certainly worth noting here that NHSX have insisted that the app will be voluntary for the public, and that limited personal information will be required. However, issues then arise as to the effectiveness of the app. A recent <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2241041-there-are-many-reasons-why-covid-19-contact-tracing-apps-may-not-work/#ixzz6L1D31UCv\">Oxford University study</a> found that the UK would need at least 80% of the public to use it in order for it to be effective. Even so, it is not clear that this alone would allow us to achieve South Korea-like suppression of the virus. After all, their approach was combined with <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-south-koreas-success-in-controlling-disease-is-due-to-its-acceptance-of-surveillance-134068\">extreme levels</a> of video surveillance, as well as mass testing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Mutt Burgess also reported for <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/contact-tracing-apps-coronavirus\">Wired</a>, “<em>NHS documents show officials were considering adding the ability to send out notifications when people had been outside for too long”</em>. Such a message would go beyond the initial claims of what the app could do. At a time when people are legitimately concerned about the spread of the virus, and when the use of such an app could allow us all to be out of lockdown earlier, few would complain about a minor overreach by the government. After all, surely they’re just doing it to keep us all safer?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well Edward Snowden, who has previously exposed the extent of mass NSA spying, has added his thoughts on the issue of track-and-trace apps in a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/edward-snowden-coronavirus-surveillance-new-powers-2020-3?r=US&amp;IR=T\">recent interview</a>”: &#8220;<em>Five years later the coronavirus is gone, this data&#8217;s still available to them — they start looking for new things&#8230; they already know what you&#8217;re looking at on the internet, they already know where your phone is moving, now they know your heart rate. What happens when they start to intermix these and apply AI?</em>&#8220;.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Y75bcPuIeQCYWO9OyaG_SPbdtMxoQ5Xdl-Jp_JhfRmti6fCktD-gziLXixUmOPQZeNS0ihl3uCWb64yiDH_E2fYwPuXQVEZmR3UHwm405-mbKbk4CRuSGr7pnVwlaf_h0LZuGuWa\" alt=\"\" width=\"214\" height=\"129\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue here is about ‘mission creep’. As with the Patriot Act after 9/11, the bill was passed at a time of extreme public fear, and faced very little scrutiny. That law has now been in force for 19 years, is unlikely to be removed for a long time- and has gone well beyond what the initial scope was meant to be (catching terrorists). As such, whilst these contact-tracing apps may help us in the short-term, the long term consequences should be a major consideration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/04/contact-tracing-apps-privacy-in-europe/\">As Amnesty International have argued</a>: <em>“</em><strong><em>Contact tracing apps must be limited in scope, with a clearly defined purpose and constraints. There is so much opportunity for mission creep here, with states collecting data ‘just in case’ or attempting to merge information with existing databases. Any contact tracing app must be subject to rigorous and regular review by independent data protection authorities to ensure that app use is in line with human rights and data protection laws and standards</em></strong>”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite their protestations, it seems unlikely that governments (particularly ours- anyone remember the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/29/snoopers-charter-bill-becomes-law-extending-uk-state-surveillance\"><em>Snoopers Charter?</em></a>) will be paying too much attention to civil liberties, which means we’re going to have to watch them carefully.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The aim of this article is not to encourage conspiracy theorism or to suggest that we should actively refuse to use something that may help us in solving this Coronavirus problem. Instead, I would just like people to be more aware of the direction-of-travel which apps like this are sending us in. The increase in government surveillance for public health/security, the use of our online data by big-tech, targeted advertising, and AI are likely to be major political trends of the next few decades. These things all aim to make our lives safer and easier. But, do we want to be giving up our privacy and freedom for security and convenience? The answer to that may be yes, but we should at least be asking the question.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further Reading:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to know more about the use/potential use of contact-tracing apps both here and around the world, or about government surveillance/data collection more generally, I would strongly recommend reading some of these pieces below:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-south-koreas-success-in-controlling-disease-is-due-to-its-acceptance-of-surveillance-134068\">https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-south-koreas-success-in-controlling-disease-is-due-to-its-acceptance-of-surveillance-134068</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/4/10/21215267/covid-19-contact-tracing-apps-bluetooth-coronavirus-flaws-public-health\">https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/4/10/21215267/covid-19-contact-tracing-apps-bluetooth-coronavirus-flaws-public-health</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/contact-tracing-could-free-america-from-its-quarantine-nightmare/609577/\">https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/contact-tracing-could-free-america-from-its-quarantine-nightmare/609577/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/bluetooth-contact-tracing-apps\">https://www.wired.co.uk/article/bluetooth-contact-tracing-apps</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-tracing-apps-expla/explainer-how-smartphone-apps-can-help-contact-trace-the-new-coronavirus-idUSKCN21W2I8\">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-tracing-apps-expla/explainer-how-smartphone-apps-can-help-contact-trace-the-new-coronavirus-idUSKCN21W2I8</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52442754\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52442754</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2241041-there-are-many-reasons-why-covid-19-contact-tracing-apps-may-not-work/#ixzz6L1D31UCv\">https://www.newscientist.com/article/2241041-there-are-many-reasons-why-covid-19-contact-tracing-apps-may-not-work/#ixzz6L1D31UCv</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/12/13/surveillance-is-a-fact-of-life-so-make-privacy-a-human-right\">https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/12/13/surveillance-is-a-fact-of-life-so-make-privacy-a-human-right</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/edward-snowden-coronavirus-surveillance-new-powers-2020-3?r=US&amp;IR=T\">https://www.businessinsider.com/edward-snowden-coronavirus-surveillance-new-powers-2020-3?r=US&amp;IR=T</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://charleseisenstein.org/essays/the-coronation/?_page=5\">https://charleseisenstein.org/essays/the-coronation/?_page=5</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Glyn Sheldon</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211;

There are things we want to achieve or aspire to in various areas of our lives.&nbsp;Recently, I have read and listened to the same concept popping up continuously; an intention board. I had no idea what an intention board was about three weeks ago, but the more I hear and learn about them the more I&#8217;m tempted to create my own, however kooky my friends may think I am.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An intention board is essentially a visual representation of whatever you want to be, do or have in your life. The board is made up of a collage of both words and pictures to embody these ideas and help manifest your intentions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those of us fortunate enough to work from home over the past few weeks have had a lot more time on our hands. Therefore, considering what you want from life once this period has passed and assembling it onto a board sounds quite positive. Believe it or not, it has been proven to work, so start thinking about those pound signs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Planning to start the week off right and bring more positivity into your life? What better way to do this than to build an intention board? Start as you mean to go on! Research has told me that the words and pictures you place on your intention board can come true if you have the correct mindset and ambition… I can’t promise we will be saving the world or becoming millionaires overnight though.  However, I need to stop being so pessimistic and give this a try, you never know what will come of it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, imagery. The imagery needs to be pictures that inspire or interest you. Get cutting any old magazines and newspapers, print pictures of friends, family, travel destinations, write any quotes and goals – use anything you want. I did read on one website that you need to burn incense, gather your crystals and chant whilst making the board, but I feel this might just be one step too far for all of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the board is finished, it&#8217;s best to place it somewhere you see regularly. So without realising, you are subconsciously reminding yourself of your goals and values. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are still not convinced, then look at Olympic athletes and elite sports players who have been using the visualisation technique for decades, and according to the hugely popular book <em>The Secret, &#8220;The law of attraction is forming your entire life experience and it is doing that through your thoughts. When you are visualising, you are emitting a powerful frequency out into the Universe&#8221;.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you aren’t completely spooked out by this &#8211; good luck with your board! I know I need some luck with mine…</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Annabel Rodick </em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/annabelrodick/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6d9addfa1f255d42b5aa03d2a17d8dc0?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Annabel Rodick\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/annabelrodick/\">Annabel Rodick</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

The truth is, film has been slow to adapt to the cultural changes that are so prevalent in our progressive society. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this year, Ben and I established Blantyre House Pictures as a platform to give unique and untold narratives the opportunity of becoming cinematic pieces, whilst also acting as a foundation for future projects. Our belief in BHP is that by our very nature we represent this new wave of thinking. It is clear the younger generation is reacting to the wrongs of the past and is looking to address it- that is what we aim to do through the power of the moving image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Untied laces centres around Lily Coleridge, a 21-year-old who is struggling with addiction, a result of both her abusive boyfriend and dysfunctional family life. Her journey is a brutal example of what mental illness can manifest into if neglected, it discusses the often-tragic by-product of trauma and the pressures of simply being human.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I speak from experience. Soon after starting my first year at the University of Liverpool, I found myself thrust into an environment which demanded a lot from me. University is a rare landscape where you must re-establish yourself in a social setting, you are suddenly defined by things you never were- your clothes, your music, your drug intake. Without realising it I had manifested a version of myself that best fit all these factors and lost myself in the process. This drove me into a deep depression and forced me to return home. For months I was overprescribed medicine and under-prescribed therapy, it tore both me and my family apart- a side of my life nobody at University ever saw; it was like I was living two lives. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was this tragic duality which led me to write Untied laces. Sitting around a Uni flat partaking in whatever drug was of choice that evening, I realised that behind the intoxication there is the reality of people&#8217;s lives- which often tells a much different story to their social exterior. I wrote the film as a way of expressing this dangerous illusion which is quite unique to University territory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second draft of the script is complete, and I am awaiting some much-needed feedback from friends and industry professionals. After this, we will look for funding- a task which is always fraught with difficulty. The fact is, if someone gives you money, they want twice as much back- and with big-budget action frenzies being the financial flavour of the month, our small budget indie film will have to fight for every pound. Once our funding is in place, it is a matter of gathering a cast and crew, and ultimately, going into production. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our goal is to gain acceptance into the major film festivals and seek distribution from there. There is no doubt that it is a tall ask for our first venture into this crazy business, but like any noble pursuit it demands an undying optimism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our motto is ‘Voicing the Voiceless’. We hope with Blantyre House Pictures and Untied laces, we can fulfil this mantra. For things to change you must sit with an unflinching eye and face its true nature- no matter how ugly or difficult- this is what great cinema should be. The world is changing, and we should not fear it, we should embrace the shift in power to people who have previously been rendered silent. That is everything we are about; it is everything we stand for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You can follow our progress on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/blantyrehousepictures/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/blantyrehousepictures/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> or go to our website to find out more: <a href=\"https://blantyrehousepictures.com/\">https://blantyrehousepictures.com/</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Matteo Addis</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/matteoaddis/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/70698e3280ff7be75af26cab3f76d18d?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Matteo Addis\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/matteoaddis/\">Matteo Addis</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

A compound derived from the hemp plant, CBD is now used by millions around the world for its reported benefits in treating myriad conditions: from insomnia and digestive problems to joint pain and arthritis, and even depression and anxiety.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While CBD is still the subject of intense scientific study &#8211; it remains categorised as a food supplement &#8211; but the profound benefits of the supplement as attested to by millions of users has made it the most talked about development in natural health in decades. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>So, what is CBD?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>CBD stands for Cannabidiol which is a major compound derived from the hemp plant. Hemp is a cousin of the marijuana plant but, unlike marijuana, hemp contains very low amounts of THC (the chemical that makes marijuana psychoactive). CBD cannot make you high.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CBD has been found to balance the mind and body and maintain natural wellbeing through its interaction with the body’s endo-cannabinoid system. This system regulates many of the body’s processes including sleep, appetite, mood, the immune system, and its responses to pain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally taken in oil or capsule form, CBD is now found in staggering variety of products including drinks, confectionary, skincare and vape e-liquids. And one company at vanguard of the UK CBD industry has become the most awarded in the industry, thanks to their unique vision for how CBD can in ways that suit everybody.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Green Stem CBD</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.greenstemcbd.com/\">Green Stem CBD</a> was founded in Guildford, Surrey in 2018 by two brothers and entrepreneurs Simon and Brett Horth. “My brother and I were seeking a remedy for our mother’s painful arthritis,” says Simon. “When we thought we’d exhausted all the natural treatments available, we came across CBD and the testimonies of thousands of users who’d claimed it had worked wonders across a range of ailments, including joint pain. After just a couple of doses, Mum’s pain had completely left her, and she could sleep well for the first time in years.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Green-Stem-2-1.jpeg?fit=640%2C427&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1000\" data-full-url=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Green-Stem-2-1.jpeg?fit=2402%2C1601&amp;ssl=1\" data-link=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/?attachment_id=1000\" class=\"wp-image-1000\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Green-Stem-CBD-1-scaled.jpeg?fit=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1001\" data-full-url=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Green-Stem-CBD-1-scaled.jpeg?fit=2560%2C1440&amp;ssl=1\" data-link=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/?attachment_id=1001\" class=\"wp-image-1001\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Green-Stem-CBD-1-scaled.jpeg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Green-Stem-CBD-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Green-Stem-CBD-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Green-Stem-CBD-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Green-Stem-CBD-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Green-Stem-CBD-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Green-Stem-CBD-1-scaled.jpeg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Green-Stem-CBD-1-scaled.jpeg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></figure></li></ul><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption\"><em><a href=\"https://www.greenstemcbd.com/\">Green Stem CBD</a> was founded in Guildford, Surrey in 2018 by two brothers and entrepreneurs Simon and Brett Horth</em><br></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>After seeing the astonishing effects experienced by their mother, Simon and Brett knew they were on to something special. “We were so excited about CBD’s potential to help other people, enhancing their lifestyle and supporting their bodies’ natural defences, that we founded Green Stem CBD.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure their products contained only the very best CBD, the brothers went straight to the source: Colorado, USA. The sunny climate combined with clean soil, fresh mountain air and the purest water, filtered over centuries through the Rockies, produce the best CBD in the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the purest CBD at their fingertips, Green Stem CBD quickly developed a product line that has since made the company one of the most recognisable and trusted CBD brands in the UK, winning Ten industry awards at the <a href=\"https://www.hempandcbdexpo.co.uk/\">UK CBD and Hemp Expo</a>, including Best CBD Oil three times in a row, Best Cosmetic for CBD-infused Lip Balm and Best Edibles for their CBD fruit-flavoured Gummies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, who can benefit the most from CBD? “Just about everyone,” says Simon. “No matter your age or level of overall health, CBD is a completely safe way to support your body and mind’s natural balance. Even athletes can take CBD without being disqualified as it contains no psychoactive elements.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What form of CBD you take merely depends on what you decide best suits your lifestyle, explains Simon. “Edibles such as our <a href=\"https://www.greenstemcbd.com/cbd-edibles.html\">gummies</a> are delicious and effective if you’re on the go, but a drop of <a href=\"https://www.greenstemcbd.com/cbd-oil.html\">CBD oil</a> beneath your tongue in the morning might well set you up for the entire day. People who exercise or do manual work would enjoy Green Stem’s nutritional skincare range, and anyone can unwind with a Green Stem <a href=\"https://www.greenstemcbd.com/cbd-tonic-water.html\">tonic</a> drink.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Green Stem’s success may look like it happened overnight, but it’s taken an unwavering commitment to using only the best CBD in the world and providing it to customers in the safest, most beneficial and enjoyable way possible that has drawn thousands of customers to their products.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We don’t take our loyal following lightly,” says Simon. “It’s our customers that keep us seeking out new ways to make CBD as fun and life-enhancing as possible”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may be too early to label CBD a ‘wonder drug’ despite its phenomenal popularity, but with companies like Green Stem CBD supplying the remarkable compound in such a dizzying array of delicious and – and effective – forms, there’s never been a better time to find out if CBD can make a difference in your life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Find Green Stem CBD on </strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/greenstemcbd/?hl=en\"><strong>Instagram</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/greenstemcbd\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a><strong> and visit them at <a href=\"https://www.greenstemcbd.com/\">www.greenstemcbd.com</a></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\" class=\"has-background has-text-align-center has-very-light-gray-background-color\"><em><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>CBD is currently licensed as a <strong>food product only</strong>, so <strong>NO medical claims</strong> can be made regarding CBD’s effects on health.

As a mark of respect for the amazing work the NHS and Key Workers are doing, the applause touches those who have been helping vulnerable people on the front line. Yet, I can’t help but notice that care workers aren’t getting the recognition they deserve.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have come here to cast a fresh perspective on the rather notoriously ‘unglamorous’ occupation of being a social care worker. It is hard to restrain our minds from immediately associating care work with ‘wiping old arse’ as Jay from the Inbetweeners courteously put it, or from thinking that care work involves shouting very loudly in the ear of an extremely deaf elderly woman. Granted – these are of course things that <em>might</em> be involved as <em>part </em>of the usual carers’ duties alongside other fundamentals of personal care.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;When looking to get myself a part-time job, I never thought of venturing into social care.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I was certainly guilty of initially creating this idea of what care work was in my head and regrettably belittled the thought of a caring job. When looking to get myself a part-time job, I never thought of venturing into social care. But since…yes it MUST be mentioned… the bleeding coronavirus came about, I noticed that the majority of job advertisements surrounding my local area were care related.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, one month in and I am a carer. Yes, I have wiped old arse; yes, I have yelled into the ear of an extremely deaf woman; yes, I have stripped down men and women to wash them. But these are some of the tasks <em>we</em> practice on a daily basis and are incidentally the minor tasks involved with care work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Protector, guardian and godparent are all synonyms for carer. These are instrumental persons who help people feel secure and safe, but also ensure people receive the genuine human connection and relationships we all need. Many patients have dementia, so it is often a case of reassurance, sticking to routines and making them the perfect cup of tea. For other patients who are visited in their private homes, carers are the only people they might see in a day, and sometimes even a week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suppose what I am trying to get across is that there is more to care work beyond the hands-on, physicality of the role. Despite the long hours and sometimes emotional visits, care staff try their utmost best to give people the independence and vitality they once had. My eyes have been opened into a completely new part of our society. I urge people to look beyond those part-time catering jobs that are sought after during the holidays and instead maybe look to shadow a carer for a day. The hours are flexible, and the job is utterly rewarding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Jemima Erith </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Illustrations by Tara Pertwee</em>: <a href=\"http://www.tarapertwee.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">www.tarapertwee.com/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/jemimaerith/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b9e50ec15e2f28fa6625526bc8ba351b?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Jemima Erith\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/jemimaerith/\">Jemima Erith</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Probably too much if I am completely honest. I spend hours scrolling through Instagram, poring over the daring outfits and eccentric designs, feverishly trying to source a similar jacket to the one I saw someone sweeping down the street wearing. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, with fashion brands and systems becoming more transparent, exposing the ugly underbelly of fast fashion, I have consciously tried to adapt my consumer addictions: buying only second hand, selling via apps and taking my un-loved garments to textile recycling centres. Yet, the more I research, the more I am exposed to the reality that no matter what action I take, most my garments still end up in landfill. How? We have the means to salvage. Surely there is a way to re-use what we do not want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It made me think &#8211; why aren’t we effectively recycling clothes? Given time was currently ‘of the essence,’ I set out on a treacherous google adventure into the wide world of textile recycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong>In short. It is not the most pleasant story.</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s imagine for a moment we are an undesired, used garment. Not broken, just part of last year’s ephemeral. A conscious individual places us in a recycling bin, and we are whisked away to a specialised sorting centre. Damn. Someone accidentally threw a drink in the bin. We, and the rest of the garments go into a landfill or are incarcerated. End of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, let’s say no drink was thrown. Then, we are either hand or mechanically sorted via machines, classified by fibre and colour. Wools with wools, cotton with cotton etc. Theoretically, we can then be sent off and transformed into another capacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most often, however, the presence of zippers, buttons and labels of differing and man-made fibres prevent us from being sorted via machines or recycled without workers having to first spend hours removing them. Unfortunately, with garments being abundant and used textiles now selling for less and less, sorting businesses cannot financially afford this required labour&#8230; and we end up in landfill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>​Even if we are part of the fortunate few who do get an extended life-period, we still ultimately have to be discarded of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point is, over <strong>350,000 tones of used clothing</strong> ends up in landfill every year in the UK. For those that are recycled, <strong>only 1% of these actually come back into the textile’s chain</strong>. Most recycling processes use vast amounts of resources and chemicals and reduce the fibre quality so much that they cannot be spun into sellable garments. As with everything, whatever they are transformed into eventually ends up with all the other abandoned textiles in landfill.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/textiles1.png?resize=640%2C405&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-951\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/textiles1.png?w=704&amp;ssl=1 704w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/textiles1.png?resize=300%2C190&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The solution?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no simple answer and it is not to say you should not recycle.

The lack of scrutiny afforded to the people who are essentially holding our lives in their hands, is a shocking abdication of duty at such a vital time. Those who are making such important decisions over life-and-death decisions need to be <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.thearticle.com/media-questions-at-no10-briefings-are-woeful-here-are-20-they-should-ask\" target=\"_blank\">held to account </a>for the choices they are making, need to be forced to explain their line of thinking over such choices and, in instances where they have been unable to achieve their previously stated plans, must tell the public why this is the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This clearly hasn’t happened, and it’s likely costing lives. I certainly understand the sentiment of not wanting to be overly critical of the Government in a time of extreme crisis. The Government is clearly in an extremely difficult position right now, and to criticise them for the sake of it would be unnecessary. However, when the decisions that the Government makes in terms of not supplying anything near adequate amounts of PPE, ventilators or testing equipment- they need to have some pressure applied so that lives can be saved. Of course, there is another major reason why broadcasters have been hesitant to challenge the Government- which has to do with the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/josephmdurso/status/1254144179913003010?s=20\">‘revolving door</a>’ which exists between high-level broadcasting roles and positions within the Government Communications Departments. For more information on this, I would advise reading pieces from <a href=\"https://www.huckmag.com/perspectives/opinion-perspectives/bbc-bias-tom-mills/\">Tom Mills</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.redpepper.org.uk/going-from-a-top-bbc-job-to-tory-spin-chief-should-be-banned-its-that-simple/\">Louis Mendee</a> which explore this in great detail.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be honest though, this is only part of the problem. Mainstream broadcasters have had their standards steadily decline to the point where they are no longer equipped to make even minor criticisms of our Government.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has become increasingly evident that the TV news establishment not only defers to Government officials on a regular basis, but also often allows only a narrow range of political views to be accepted on their platforms. Frequently, this is practiced through a prism of ‘impartiality’, which broadcasters technically have to abide by- particularly during election time. Now, one can certainly make the case (<a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/bbc-election-night-and-systemic-media-bias/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">with evidence</a>) that the BBC especially failed to live up to even these standards during the recent General Election when covering <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/jeremy-corbyn-media-bias-labour-party-media-reform-coalition-birkbeck-a7163706.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Corbyn and the Labour Party</a>. I will concede though that it is certainly reasonable to expect that a Party offering such a systemic change regarding public spending, should be scrutinised. What is more concerning however, is the sheer lack of actual journalism practiced by the supposed cream of the crop.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Oy0_mLGMOEM3I_JJhubTmDxKPfzNa5o71VsfNRrSk7BVUB40Aj948dC1bkp_lige_YQfBuIn0Tvi8r-Qm_znp05mlgax29EjpD8VRU4Alvc0aVUgTQNRv6Hn8DTNytNxUm1jvdRk\" alt=\"\" width=\"288\" height=\"503\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As a side note here, it is also important to note the declining <a href=\"https://infogram.com/line-chart-1h9j6qk537l56gz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">power of the British Press</a>. Whilst still important in setting the terms of political debate (broadcasters will still provide daily coverage of what is on the front pages), the circulation figures for the major newspapers are in freefall. The right-wing Billionaire-funded tabloids (yes, the Mirror is in decline as well) are all experiencing serious declines in their numbers of readers, and their trust numbers have fallen to pitifully low levels. Once heralded as being <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/was-it-sun-wot-won-it-press-influence-in-1992-and-2015-elections/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">election winners</a> for their Party of choice, these hate-rags are no longer the dominant sources of information for the public- leaving Broadcast media as the apparent saving grace for our media landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back to impartiality though- on issues of the environment, the cost of austerity, and Brexit, was generally interpreted by broadcasters as a “Tories say this, Labour says this”- leaving viewers none the wiser as to the potential costs and benefits of various important policies. The BBC have <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-12-22/lord-hall-says-people-still-trust-the-bbc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">consistently claimed that</a>, as they are receiving complaints from both sides of the spectrum, they must be getting it right- holding onto the idea that the objective truth is always somewhere in between two opposing views. This is, of course, not even remotely accurate. As is made clear in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Klujypop/status/1018217609010012160?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">very pertinent quote</a> as a journalist: “<em>If someone says it’s raining &amp; another person says it’s dry, it’s not your job to quote them both. Your job is to look out of the fucking window and find out which is true.</em>”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The BBC has got into trouble with this before. Their coverage of climate change was frequently criticised for falsely equivocating between the views of climate scientists and those who thought it was a hoax (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/09/bbc-radio-4-broke-impartiality-rules-in-nigel-lawson-climate-change-interview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">see: Nigel Lawson</a>). Dangerously, this gave the impression that the science on the matter was still up for debate, creating room for the Government of the day to sidestep the issue of tackling it altogether.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly though, this false impartiality can cut both ways- notably so on the issue of Brexit. The BBC, terrified of appearing too <em>Remainery</em>, would regularly understate the economic arguments in favour of remaining in the EU, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://infacts.org/5-ways-bbc-falling-brexit/\" target=\"_blank\">using quotes from James Dyson</a> (a businessman who had actually moved all <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/23/james-dyson-brexiteer-elite-brexit-rees-mogg\" target=\"_blank\"> his manufacturing</a> projects overseas due to the costs involved with leaving the EU- but still argued Brexit would benefit the economy) to provide ‘balance’. Nevertheless, the BBC still justifiably caught the ire of Brexiteers by portraying them as <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2018/01/15/we-dont-exist-to-them-do-we-why-working-class-people-voted-for-brexit/\" target=\"_blank\">racist, stupid and voting </a>against their self interest failing to see the Brexit vote for what it was, a fightback against the political and economic establishment which had abandoned those outside London for decades.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/luHAAyeV9FVmdQrHszdvs2rrL5J-JvLoUWercN-xa6NOs3iBSlyB76Q_azq8P1soQG6qexMlo7hCe1W24jzO59KUlQjFa9xGtNrm3g6lgt9nll0e2FJnHOdByCtdXH-kDvrFpcQ1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Trust is an essential aspect of journalism. If your readers/viewers don’t have confidence in your ability as a journalist to provide accurate information, or crucially, if you’re not open and up-front about your preconceived views, then they won’t be able to make informed decisions with the details presented to them. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;A recent <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-britons-have-become-sadder-and-more-anxious-since-lockdown-poll-11977655\" target=\"_blank\">Sky Poll</a> found that trust levels in TV journalists are at -40%, a shocking statistic that really reveals how far these institutions have fallen.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The BBC’s recent debacles have led to their trust levels <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.newsbreak.com/news/0NhAylAy/new-poll-finds-the-bbc-is-less-trusted-than-itv-amid-concerns-over-bias\" target=\"_blank\">falling below</a> that of their competitors, a real blow for the country’s public service broadcaster. And now, in this Coronavirus era, the public has now seemingly reached the end of their tether with those who are meant to be providing us with a clearer picture of what’s going on. A recent <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-britons-have-become-sadder-and-more-anxious-since-lockdown-poll-11977655\" target=\"_blank\">Sky Poll</a> found that trust levels in TV journalists are at -40%, a shocking statistic that really reveals how far these institutions have fallen. Perhaps even more interesting is the fact that young people seem to have <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/24/young-people-uk-abandon-tv-news-almost-entirely-ofcom\" target=\"_blank\">&#8216;abandoned TV news entirely</a>’, watching only 2 minutes a day on average. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So where are we getting our news from instead? The obvious answer is social media- but it doesn&#8217;t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/03/britons-less-trusting-of-social-media-than-other-major-nations-facebook-twitter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">appear that</a> people trust much of what they see on there either. Certainly, Twitter and Facebook are often little more than echo chambers which can be rife with misinformation- so that’s to be expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With no major options available to receive useful, informative and interesting news, young people should turn to independent websites which are up-front about the viewpoints they are arguing for. If a journalist is at least open about the biases they hold, then you can be comfortable knowing they are not trying to pull one over on you- and can read the material with the critical eye it deserves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;I would recommend websites such as <a href=\"https://novaramedia.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Novara Media</a>, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Conversation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OpenDemocracy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">RT</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/topic/politics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Wired</a>&#8211; which do a better job than most at being honest with their audience. As well as this, young people should be willing to take the plunge and create the media institutions of the future which will actually provide relevant discussions of important events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not wanting to miss an opportunity for a shameless plug, I would therefore invite everyone who’s made it this far to read my other articles and all the great pieces on this website- it might even inspire you to write something yourself. There’s literally not going to be a better time to get involved and share your opinions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re interested in a more detailed look at the issues of impartiality/objectivity within news, as well as more discussion of the decline of the BBC, check out these articles/books:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2017-11/Delivering%20Trust%20Impartiality%20and%20Objectivity%20in%20a%20Digital%20Age.pdf\">https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2017-11/Delivering%20Trust%20Impartiality%20and%20Objectivity%20in%20a%20Digital%20Age.pdf</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://titiesel.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/hackett-robert-a-e2809cdecline-of-a-paradigm.pdf\">https://titiesel.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/hackett-robert-a-e2809cdecline-of-a-paradigm.pdf</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/coronavirus-had-made-the-bbcs-balancing-act-even-harder\">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/coronavirus-had-made-the-bbcs-balancing-act-even-harder</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/2243-the-bbc\">https://www.versobooks.com/books/2243-the-bbc</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/1467-923X.12296\">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/1467-923X.12296</a> (needs payment/institutional access)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-wordpress wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-pressthink\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"wiK5xtoJ4K\"><a href=\"https://pressthink.org/2010/07/objectivity-as-a-form-of-persuasion-a-few-notes-for-marcus-brauchli/\">Objectivity as a Form of Persuasion: A Few Notes for Marcus Brauchli</a></blockquote><iframe title=\"&#8220;Objectivity as a Form of Persuasion: A Few Notes for Marcus Brauchli&#8221;

At least that is what the headlines are saying. And no, not of life as we know it, but the curtains are drawing on the first battle in World War Covid (WW19). It is unclear which side has won this round, but one thing is certain, mankind will triumph in the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;No Wetherspoons, no McDonald’s and no Premier League for an entire month&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In an effort to save our world from imminent self-destruction, the Herculean resilience of the British population has been mesmerising. No Wetherspoons, no McDonald’s and no Premier League for an entire month. Few would have thought it possible that this country would have survived more than a few days once these pillars of British society had been removed. Yet it would appear that Britain can take it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This staggering abstinence has embodied the revival of ‘Blitz Spirit’ in the United Kingdom. In the name of our National Health Service, we have forced barbecues off the beaches, we have forced congestion off the streets, and we have forced festivals out of the fields and hills of Glastonbury.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a myriad of other similarities that can be drawn between this great battle and the last time Europe was under siege. Unfortunately, we can’t scapegoat the Germans this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many hotels have refashioned themselves into modern air raid shelters to protect the homeless from the airborne invasion. According to The Sunday Times, more than 5,500 rough sleepers across the country have been sheltered.Hats off to Best Western, Travelodge and The Holiday Inn for protecting some of those most vulnerable to the virus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many unsung heroes have been working for the Ministry of Defense crafting supplies for the frontline. James, a 24-year-old lad from Yorkshire, has been replenishing the troops with tools to fight the invisible enemy. He and his colleagues have been braving the outside world to make sure the NHS are supplied, at all times, with another bastion of British society: The Meal Deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-1.png?resize=343%2C247&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-945\" width=\"343\" height=\"247\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-1.png?w=451&amp;ssl=1 451w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-1.png?resize=300%2C215&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><em>Nurses marching alongside munitions workers during WWII c. 1942</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>These sandwich makers are the modern-day embodiment of ‘Canary Girls’. The WWII female munitions factory workers, so named because their skin was dyed yellow by the sulphuric chemicals that they handled. Luckily, making a BLT is not as complex as fusing TNT, but there is undoubtedly a subtle art to both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those in doubt, the Army has publicly quashed rumours that it is taking part in a large culinary exercise in Wembley Stadium to stave off food rationing (see image below).</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-04-at-17.35.34.png?fit=640%2C87&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-962\" width=\"599\" height=\"81\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-04-at-17.35.34.png?w=1439&amp;ssl=1 1439w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-04-at-17.35.34.png?resize=300%2C41&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-04-at-17.35.34.png?resize=1024%2C139&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-04-at-17.35.34.png?resize=768%2C104&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-04-at-17.35.34.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>However, our armed forces have been deployed to redistribute Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) across the country and to support where needed.Another army, this one of volunteers, has sprung up across the land as first responders, virus testers, or even just helpful grocery shoppers. Everyone is playing their part in some way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the comfort of his own patio Captain Tom Moore, the centurion war veteran, has raised over £30 million pounds for the war effort against the deadly virus. Pensioners these days really are a marvel and must be protected at all costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Body Coach, Joe Wicks, has reincarnated himself as the nation’s PE teacher in order to keep schoolchildren on the Home Front fit and ready for battle. Now, British children will be ready to take up arms and fight against the imminent second wave of viral invasion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the delivery drivers, shelf stackers, street sweepers, bin collectors and many other key workers, we remain fed and content. Thanks to the valiant doctors and nurses thousands of lives will be saved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with Friday 8th May being the 75th Anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe (VE Day), this country-wide unity seems like the most fitting tribute. Well, that, and thankfully it’s also a bank holiday.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Caspar Barnes</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/casparbarnes/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/451c66e4edc94eef5ca562047168c717?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Caspar Barnes\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/casparbarnes/\">Caspar Barnes</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Yet since this has become a daily occurrence in lockdown, it’s started to lose its taste of freedom. I have found myself missing a trip to the cinema. A lot. Don’t get me wrong, I loved going to the cinema before. But weeks in isolation has left me pining for the sticky floors of Islington Vue possibly more than I want to down a lukewarm pint in a Spoons beer garden. And that’s really saying something.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a distinct charm of rocking up to the cinema &#8211; usually a whole minute and a half before the film begins &#8211; and knowing you’ve paid about 7 quid for a cinema ticket. When you booked online you smugly thought about the idiots paying twice the price at Picture House to see exactly the same film, but in a fancier building with kooky light fittings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, you make a beeline to the Pick ‘n’ Mix section. If you are, like me, a five year old in an adult’s body, the cinema trip is only legitimate with mountains of sugar. Many people have definitely touched the fudge, the fizzy cherries are so sour they obliterate your taste buds and you don’t even want to think about the germ count on the scoops. But god dammit everything (even the chocolate raisins) tastes delicious. Having taken far too long to pick out your gourmet sweet selection you sashay to the counter and whack your bag on the scales. You’ve often got far too carried away and it ends up costing twelve pounds. By this point you might as well have gone to Picture House.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;You burst open the screen door to the cacophony of rustling popcorn.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>You jog swiftly to screen number 5 after a hurried wee in the one toilet that isn’t out of order. Seeing as we’re all more practiced in the art of queuing, I’ll never complain about waiting for a damp loo cubicle again. At least it has toilet roll. You burst open the screen door to the cacophony of rustling popcorn. You’ve timed it perfectly so that you’ve missed the five thousand car adverts and can really get your teeth into the film trailers as well as your sweets, which you will no doubt finish before the film has even begun.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the lights fade. The shiver of joy you experience when the licensing page appears never quite loses its kick. The nauseating couple in front of you who have been snogging all through the trailers show no sign of stopping so you give their chairs a swift boot to give them the hint. For the next hour and a half or so, you are nestled in the little dark tardis of the cinema, absorbed in the unfolding world of the film. The screen’s edges fade and you’re transported to 1800’s rural Massachusetts, deep space or downtown Seoul. Everyone in this dark box is on the same journey, where for once you turn everything off and just watch.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;I long for those rare moments when the film’s been so good that people awkwardly give a little applause.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CInema-2.jpeg?resize=357%2C529&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-930\" width=\"357\" height=\"529\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CInema-2.jpeg?zoom=2&amp;resize=357%2C529&amp;ssl=1 714w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CInema-2.jpeg?zoom=3&amp;resize=357%2C529&amp;ssl=1 1071w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In these times of isolation I miss cinema’s community most. When you’re all sat, laughing, gasping and sometimes crying together over a character you didn’t know forty minutes ago. I miss the millisecond gap of silence when the screen’s gone dark, just before the credits begin and everyone sits there and exhales, thinking about what they’ve just seen. I long for those rare moments when the film’s been so good that people awkwardly give a little applause. Then, almost as quickly as it’s begun, you float back out the doors, blinking in the sunlight, trying to shake yourself back into reality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going to the cinema is much more than a cheap thrill; it immerses you in a different perspective or another world entirely. It can help us all understand and appreciate life a little better. Or simply, a cinema trip can make the day a bit sweeter. Streaming at home has its merits, but it never quite lives up to the occasion of a cinema trip. Right now I would trade lonely home viewing for the touched sweets, broken toilets and annoying couples in a heartbeat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chain cinemas will most probably survive these testing times but it is the smaller cinemas that may not. As much as I cherish my beloved Vue, we should all visit our local independent cinemas when they reopen, because the majority struggle to compete with the big screen ballers as it is. They champion a huge variety of screenings, from supporting the underdog films to promoting the hidden gems. So once we’re all back frolicking in the sunshine (or the snow – who knows!), spare a thought for independent cinemas for your next film fix, they’re going to need all the help they can get.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>MUBI has set up a UK Cinemas Fund to help independent cinemas and film festivals stay afloat during and after the current pandemic.

Also a time when I was completing my 200 hour Yoga Teacher Training in Goa, India. As much as this was inspiring, transformational and challenging (both physically and mentally), I am not here to gloat about the winter sun, preach about the importance of yoga in my life or inspire you to roll out your mat (although that would be a bonus). I want to discuss all the tools I learnt BEYOND the physical practice of yoga itself, and invite you to shift your perspective of ‘but I’m not flexible’ and hear a little about how yogic practice might actually benefit your daily life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I flirted with the idea of yoga for a few years, but committing to daily practice started in a search to suppress my anxious thoughts and connect body and mind. Initially, I viewed yoga as exercise, but I have since learnt the incredible depth these teachings have to offer and I want to share it with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vanda Scaravelli describes yoga as ‘an effortless dance with breath and gravity’&#8230; and I get it… being told downward facing dog is your ‘resting pose’ and binding your body round in eagle as your teacher takes FOREVER to count down from 5 might not always feel ‘effortless’. But, the noticeable changes I started feeling in my body and mind after practice could not be ignored. I realise that everyone is different and that this form of movement might not be for you, but I believe that as human beings we need to reconnect to this state of ‘being’. For this, yogic teachings and practices can help massively.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, we are living in a world where understanding our mental health is becoming equally as important as maintaining physical health and this concept has always been prevalent in yogic philosophy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some, yoga is their new kick-ass leggings and a catch up with friends whilst sipping on turmeric lattes. For others, it is an essential part of a daily routine which provides a bedrock for both physical and mental health. By definition, ‘yoga’ means ‘union’ of the mind, body and soul and although I am not here to take you through the teacher training syllabus, I feel it necessary to supply some wider context. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was trained and now teach in Ashtanga (translated as ‘eight limb’) and Vinyasa (translated as ‘to place in a special way’). Over 2,500 years ago, an ancient Indian sage called Patanjali wrote The Yoga Sutras on the theory and practice of yoga. Within these are the ‘eight limbs of yoga’ offering observances and practices to settle the mind into silence and establish our own essential state of consciousness. The physical aspect of yoga, which is commonly practiced in the West, is only one eighth of this path, implying there’s more than <em>just</em> stretching to reach a calm bliss.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have done my best to create six ways in which traditional yogic practices can be incorporated into your daily life. From my teachers, to me, to you. Enjoy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>1- The Act of Self-Love&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The first limb of yoga, Yamas, focuses on our behaviour and how we conduct ourselves in everyday life. ‘Ahimsa’ is a principle of non-violence which applies to all living beings INCLUDING yourself. So take your gaze inwards, be kinder and less critical of yourself and your thoughts. Self-love is not selfish, it is bold and brave. Run a bubble bath, cook yourself a nourishing meal, go to bed early to read. However this manifests for you, I encourage you <em>today</em> to do one self-loving act.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>2- Mindful Walking</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Walking, something most of us can do. It requires little to no thinking, right? Allow me to shift your perspective and turn walking into an act of mindfulness. The second limb, Niyamas, are five ethical principles focussing on how we live in our bodies incorporating observances and self-disciplines. For self-discipline, plan an occasion to try your first mindful walk, and stick to it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next observance &#8211; When you walk, <em>observe</em> how your body feels through the connection of your feet to the earth. Use your senses to tap in to the present, look up and around, what can you smell, what can you taste, what can you hear? Congratulations! You are <em>mindfully</em> walking. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwbRERIzt6c\"><strong>Headspace</strong></a><strong> </strong>has great guided mindful walks and runs that I highly recommend.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>3- Journalling</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Marilyn Monroe once wrote ‘to think in ink’, which beautifully captures the purpose of journaling. All you need is a pen and paper, but if you want to make it aesthetically pleasing, <a href=\"https://www.papier.com/stationery/notebooks/\">Papier</a> do beautiful personalised journals. If you need some writing guidance, maybe start by outlining your day. I am a LOVER of lists and I definitely encourage them in journalling. Here’s a couple of ideas:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>5 things you are grateful for</li><li>5 aspirations and how you are going to achieve them&nbsp;</li><li>Set yourself a <a href=\"https://www.yogiapproved.com/om/5-morning-mantras/\">morning mantra</a> or positive affirmation for the day ahead.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also fab Instagram accounts such as @journaling.prompts which can give you some inspiration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>4- Pranayama &#8211; The Fourth Limb&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In yoga, ‘prana’ is the breath which is considered as a life-giving force. I mean, what would we be without the breath? Daily pranayama can improve blood circulation, concentration, relieving stress, anxiety and depression. If that isn’t a reason to give it a go, I don’t know what is. Here are a few of my favourites (examples are linked):</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Disclaimer: For maximum effect &#8211; try these in the morning before using phone, drinking your coffee or having sex. (Not to put you off any of these!)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VwufJrUhic\"><strong>Nadi Shodhana</strong></a><strong> </strong>&#8211; Beneficial for anxiety and relaxation.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY00OwIjPj8\"><strong>Kapalabhati </strong></a><strong>&#8211; </strong>Increase in<strong> </strong>blood circulation, digestion, and energy.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZYOOCpMGk0\"><strong>Bhramari Pranayama</strong></a><strong> &#8211; </strong>Helpful with stress, headaches, anger and insomnia.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>5- Meditation</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main purposes of the physical practice of yoga is to help hold meditative postures for longer. For this example, I am going to mention Joe Wicks (rogue, I know). Familiar to us all as a fitness coach, he has recently taken to meditation to test the effects on his mental health. Following his progress on social media has reaffirmed my belief that meditation is a unique journey and committing to regular practice will help you discover what works for you. Try it yourself &#8211; there are endless guided meditations on Headspace, Youtube and Spotify. If you have never quite clicked with the conventional ways, maybe try a GABA Podcast. I would also HIGHLY recommend the book ‘Mind Calm: The Modern-Day Meditation Technique that Gives You ‘Peace With Mind’ by Sandy C. Newbigging.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>6- Yoga</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In my opinion, I would recommend the physical practice alongside these other examples. Greater strength, flexibility and circulation are all pretty convincing reasons to give it a go. If that isn’t enough, name another form of exercise which you finish by lying on the floor, relaxing and covering yourself with a blanket&#8230; I&#8217;ll wait.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Since being home, I have been teaching <em>free </em>yoga for all levels on my instagram @hannahs_yoga, please feel free to follow me and join in when you can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Namaste. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Hannah Simmonds </em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/hannahsimmonds/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff1adeb710310399e906ec644252c55b?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Hannah Simmonds\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/hannahsimmonds/\">Hannah Simmonds</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

At a very, <em>very</em> basic level, smiles tend to use around 10 muscles, whereas an ultra-<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/emotions/muscles-smile1.htm\" target=\"_blank\">simple frown uses about 6</a><a href=\"https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/emotions/muscles-smile1.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">*</a><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/emotions/muscles-smile1.htm\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></span>. However &#8211; muscular effort aside &#8211; if we take a brief, but slightly more detailed look at the facts and ideas behind smiling, we find that there are encouraging reasons to indeed spend more of our time with a grin plastered across our face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s begin with some of the research. Studies suggest that smiling <em>makes you feel good. </em>This can be both smiling yourself, or seeing others smile. On a fundamental level, ‘good feelings’ are essentially our brain sending off certain signals to our body when stimulated by something external. (<em>Note</em>: I am painfully aware that I am some way off having a proper scientific understanding of the brain, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/everything-you-need-to-know-about-happiness-science-a6792031.html\" target=\"_blank\">but this article*</a> &#8211; although far too ‘science-y’ for me &#8211; explains it more completely. If you’re into that sort of thing).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;That is a mind-blowing statistic to support the power of a simple smile.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>So. These brain signals make us feel good. <a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/health/one-smile-can-make-you-feel-million-dollars-2469850\">One particular study*</a> concluded that seeing the smile of someone you love and care about can produce the same amount of happiness &#8211; i.e the same amount of ‘good-feeling&#8217; brain signals &#8211; as eating 600 chocolate bars. <em>Six hundred!</em> A smile from a friend is roughly equivalent <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://yuobserver.org/2014/05/the-power-of-smiling-worth-its-weight-in-chocolate/\" target=\"_blank\">to 200 chocolate bars</a>*. Great news if you like chocolate. The first of these articles also point out that the study even concluded that particularly a child’s smile produced the same amount of positive stimulation as receiving 16,000 pounds. That is a mind-blowing statistic to support the power of a simple smile. (Yeah, I’m not convinced on that one either to be honest. Smiles are great. But sixteen grand? Do me a favour).  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway &#8211; on these grounds, then, you have the power to produce <em>a lot</em> of good feelings in the people you care about &#8211; just by smiling at them! Doesn’t this seem as good a reason as any to make a conscious effort to genuinely smile at those around you? Even without having your brain signals scientifically monitored, anyone can notice that real, honest and warm smiles from those around them improve their mood, even if only a small amount.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This leads us onto our next reason to smile: it’s contagious! Both smiling and laughter are considered ‘contagious’, in the sense that we are likely to smile and/or laugh if someone else is, even if we aren’t aware of it. This is essentially because of our human instinct to mimic the emotions and gestures of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.livescience.com/9430-study-laughter-contagious.html\" target=\"_blank\">those with whom we interact, so as to help us develop social connections*.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Imagine taking it upon yourself to <em>genuinely</em> smile at three people today.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We tend to ‘copycat’ positive emotions far more than negative ones; smiling and laughter is thus more ‘contagious’ than anything else. I completely agree, the idea of ‘spreading’ smiles is a bit &#8211; for want of a better word &#8211; wanky. But surely it’s at least worth trying? Imagine taking it upon yourself to <em>genuinely</em> smile at three people today. You might, even for a brief moment, pass on the (might I add, <em>proven</em>) good feeling that comes with a smile to someone else. Who knows, that smile might stay with one of those people, who then carries it over to someone else, who carries it over to someone else &#8211; and so on. And if you’re on your own, try smiling at yourself in a mirror. I’m getting ahead of myself, and this is a hugely idealistic approach, but you get the idea: its infectious nature seems another solid reason to smile.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We live in challenging times. Covid-19 has taught us all a shocking, but truly important lesson: <em>some things are simply out of our control</em>. All of us have had plans, goals, and ideas interrupted by the virus. We cannot change that. Amidst this, however, there is a chance to become aware of the importance of the smaller things. To bring to prominence those small parts of daily life that are all too easily neglected in our otherwise busy and often frantic lifestyles. The third reason, then, is simple: there is one of these small parts that, no matter what comes your way, will always be under your control:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your smile! The energy that you put out into the world before you. <em>That will always be yours</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every person has different reasons to smile, and different things that make them happy. Hopefully, the three reasons put forward here are applicable to anyone and everyone. I encourage you to try it; just devote one day to being conscious of your smiling, and note the effect. Smile with sincerity and smile with purpose. It’s the least we can do to even slightly improve the wellbeing of both ourselves and of those around us.

Evenings that would have been spent at the pub with my friends, sipping a large glass of the house white wine, seem to have been replaced with sipping a large glass of any white wine whilst sat on the sofa scrolling. If this is ‘the new normal’ I want to make sure that my newsfeed has a positive impact on my day and brings me joy. The best way to do that? Think of your newsfeed as an art gallery curated by you, for you, to benefit you! Revolutionary ey!? Anyway, here are some feel-good-follows you might like to have a look at.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>1. <strong>Dudette with a Sign &#8211; @dudettewithasign</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ve heard of Dude with a Sign, but have you heard of Dudette with a Sign? Her simple and direct messages held up on cardboard say what we are all thinking.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-k5jQxg9mA/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

I know that lots of people who I have been talking to have been falling into the trap of social media unconsciously seeping in to our minds and conditioning leading to feelings of guilt, inadequacy, and a whole case of the ‘shoulds’. ✨ The one that has been coming up the most for clients, friends and family of mine is our daily ‘routines’. ✨⠀⠀ I often worry about posting the specifics of what I do with my health, wellness, spirituality, creativity in apprehension of triggering these aforementioned feelings within other people. So I just wanted to remind you all to treat anything you consume on social media as a sort of ‘take it or leave it’ invitation. ✨ Take ideas from the people you follow, play around with them, if they feel good then you can integrate it into your life, if they don’t feel good then LEAVE IT. And feel confident about leaving it, not guilty, not inadequate, not that you really should’ be doing it. ✨⠀⠀ I wake up each morning and ask myself: ⠀⠀ &#8211; What do I want &#8211; What do I need &#8211; How can I serve myself and others ✨⠀⠀ And then you can go about your day in accordance with what comes up. And this will be different every single day. So don’t worry about your days having the same exercise plan, the same foods, the same rituals, at the same time, every single day. Because we are HUMANS we are not robots. And we have different wants and needs every day. It is your job to tune in to YOU. Honour YOU. ✨ Wake up in the morning, place a hand on your heart and understand where your day needs to take you in order to best support yourself emotionally, physically, spiritually. ✨ What people share on their social media is an offering, an insight into what works for THEM, an invitation to you as a possibility that it perhaps might help you too, but if it doesn’t THAT IS FINE TOO! You do you. ✨⠀⠀ Let Instagram inspire and uplift you. Not drag you down into the depths of self berating. We need now more than ever to be looking after ourselves, and offering ourselves tenderness and love ❤️ Go gently.</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;

One thing that can help, I find, is to create a To Do list with a set of clear, achievable goals. Here’s an example of one, written in the form of a poem. It’s called ‘To Do List’.</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/brian_bilston/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Brian Bilston</a> (@brian_bilston) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-03-23T08:03:55+00:00\">Mar 23, 2020 at 1:03am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote><script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Philippa Strahan </em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/philippastrahan/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e423878383e412b23d8a42546957320d?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Philippa Strahan\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/philippastrahan/\">Philippa Strahan</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Complete lockdown is over. You put on your brand spanking new summer best and head out the door to finally say hello to that ice-cold pint that’s been calling your name for so long. As you swagger across into the car, you skip through your newly added playlist to find the perfect song, your breath of fresh air, your soundtrack to the end of a difficult time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a DJ and part-time music nerd, I’m the kind of person who thinks about this way too far in advance. Having set up a music sharing platform on Facebook called ‘International Extraterrestrial Music’ back in 2018, these are the kinds of questions that now 3000 fellow music obsessives often ask each other.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IEM.jpg?resize=640%2C640&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-884\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IEM.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IEM.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IEM.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IEM.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IEM.jpg?resize=500%2C500&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><em>&#8216;International Extraterrestrial Music&#8217; is available to join by request on Facebook</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Music for the morning? Music for the shower? Or weirder questions as far as &#8211; anyone got anything similar that sounds a bit like the cast of Jumanji falling down the stairs?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These strange quirks are what we do as a community &#8211; we share stories, pose situations and all-in-all learn through listening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here goes, I asked my online community of fanatics this very question and here are a couple of the finest responses for your very ears, to soundtrack that pending moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Underwater – Harry Thumann&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Can’t think of a much better song to have playing in the car on the way to the pub’ &#8211; Will Sutcliffe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lighting up dancefloors since 1979, Harry Thumanns tried and tested disco slammer will help you on your way. Be careful, cars have a tendency to take off and turn into spaceships once you press play.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Kay Cee &#8211; Love Stimulation (Trance Club Mix) &#8211; 1999</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Something fairly euphoric and rolling – it doesn’t get much better than this’ – Chris Hobbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtesy gave this 1999 trance roller the credit it really deserves by slamming it halfway through her Dekmantel Boiler room back in 2019. Rolling pads and building melodic rhythms make this a perfect choice to bust out smiles and moves in equal measure – oh one thing, bucket hats and big box little box are required when listening.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Oye Cómo Va – Tito Puente</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>‘If the sun isn’t already beaming, she’ll have no choice when the needle drops on this beauty. One of the most infectious tracks I’ve ever heard and one that needs no introduction. An old friend for the good times, that enhances them indefinitely’ – Ollie Slaney.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes the best songs don’t need an introduction, just a friendly prod on the shoulder to remind you of their beauty. Why are both my hands in the air? Oh, right yeah, tune.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Z@P &#8211; Tracid</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>‘This song has been on my mind a lot lately’ – Douglas McConachie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pulsing drums backed by heavily emotive melodies make this a popular choice – the perfect balance between push and pull &#8211; a melancholic journey towards your final destination &#8211; that ice-cold pint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I licked the back of a battery once. It tasted like this’</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Everything in its Right Place – Radiohead (Joe Claussell edit)</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Gives me goose bumps every time’ – Hough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>House mainstay Joe Claussell puts a dancey spin on the Radiohead classic you never knew needed that extra boost. I hadn’t heard this edit before, despite the original making it into my hypothetical desert island discs &#8211; genuinely giving me shivers listening to this right now – musical perfection.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I&#8217;ve added a couple myself for good measure</em>&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>New Atlantic &#8211; I know</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A bit like a Babybel &#8211; Desperately cheesy. Perfectly executed. A truly brilliant concoction of nostalgia, cheap thrills and uplifting motifs.

From Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey to Martin Luther King Jr. and Desmond Tutu; from Mitt Romney and Richard Nixon to John McDonnell and Pope Francis. Having support from across the political spectrum can be a pretty good measure of the future success- but it’s certainly no guarantee. So what exactly is a ‘Universal Basic Income’, and is it worth fighting for?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put simply, a Universal Basic Income is the idea of the government giving every citizen in a country (universal) a regular payment which would allow them to have their fundamental needs covered (basic income). No strings attached.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Democratic Presidential Candidate, Andrew Yang, when putting this forward as his signature policy proposal during the 2020 campaign, suggested the amount given to citizens would be £1000/month. Meanwhile, Labour’s Shadow Education Secretary (and runner-up in the recent Leadership Race), Rebecca Long-Bailey <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/labours-rebecca-longbailey-urges-boris-johnson-to-bring-in-universal-basic-income-to-help-brits-through-coronavirus-crisis\">called for a UBI</a> to match the UK living wage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2020/03/24/why-an-emergency-universal-basic-income-makes-sense-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/\">First proposed in <em>Utopia</em></a><em>, </em>Thomas More’s 1516 satirical book- to “provide everyone with some means of livelihood, so that nobody’s under the frightful necessity of becoming, first a thief, and then a corpse”- UBI can be viewed as the ultimate safety net to ensure no citizen falls into complete financial despair, despite their circumstances. We do already have a welfare system in place in the UK though. It might fall <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/universal-credit-doesnt-cover-essential-14022020\">desperately short</a> of providing enough money for people to live on, but it is <em>something. </em>Surely we can just increase the current benefits? Why do we need something completely new?</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;It’s now become even more obvious that the £410/month provided in the Universal Credit system is not even close to sufficient&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Well there’s two major circumstantial reasons why UBI is preferable to the current benefits system. Starting with the most pressing issue: Coronavirus- the pandemic has led to millions of people being left without jobs, either furloughed using the Government’s job retention scheme, asked to take a pay cut, having their hours reduced, or being laid off completely. It’s now become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-universal-credit-lockdown-claimants\">even more obvious</a> that the £410/month provided in the Universal Credit system is not even close to sufficient. Further compounding this, the recent influx of claims due to Corona-related job losses has meant that the waiting time of 5 weeks for the first payment has now gone up, leaving many unable to pay rent, bills and buy food and other essentials.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Universal Credit was originally introduced as a replacement to the previous welfare system which had different payments for the six types of benefits originally provided- in an attempt to simplify the system. The other apparent advantage of UC was that it would increase the amount of people in employment, largely because UC itself isn’t financially viable, but also through supposed improvements to the administrative system used to find jobs for people. However, not only did UC not achieve its stated goal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/14/computer-says-no-the-people-trapped-in-universal-credits-black-hole\">before Coronavirus hit</a>, but this crisis has now massively reduced the possibility of anyone being able to find work. Recently, one of the main architects of Universal Credit <a href=\"https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/w/spain-become-first-european-country-introduce-universal-basic-income\">Iain Duncan Smith argued </a>that replacing UC with a UBI would be “a disincentive to work”- clearly missing the point that we don’t actually want people to be going to work whilst a highly contagious virus is working its way through the population.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as this, UBI helps to support the huge numbers of people who have been completely left out of both the original furlough scheme, and the additional funds given to those who were self-employed. There are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/18/new-starters-furlough-loophole-britain-coronavirus-support-newly-hired-staff-seasonal-workers\">countless examples</a> of people who happened to get laid off just before the furlough scheme came in, or have found the government’s calculation of their self-employment to be <a href=\"https://www.cipd.co.uk/news-views/news-articles/cipd-self-employed-support-covid-19\">woefully inadequate</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In these circumstances, with the economy crashing in front of our eyes, and people no longer having their regular income met- UBI seems like an ideal solution to ensure that no one is left behind during this crisis.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_L2ehDtmDxt8INEFPgWK-r9I3jvi3duARltHB8AgSAerwsTl0zhLEMHtCLYtFGUqykzn5-HavI1h4-0Zk5o3UYVQzVPyJDgTzqVobvo6nPhghnlosJ29McNURIET-IZZEwd34DEf\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the long term, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f931514-e46e-11e9-b112-9624ec9edc59\">UBI could be viewed as an essential policy</a> to combat the increasing presence of automation within industry. You only need to take a cursory look into a McDonald’s or a Tesco to see how the rise of robots is affecting the world of work. It is becoming clear that in the near future, two of the most common areas of employment: manual factory work, and lorry driving, will be automated away. If vast proportions of the population are going to be out of work, the government will have to step up and provide some form of financial support to compensate them. Is UBI therefore a fix-all solution for our current crisis and the problems which lie ahead?</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;The most obvious, and most commonly cited, issue with bringing in a UBI is simply it’s enormous cost.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Well the policy is certainly not without its critics. The most obvious, and most commonly cited, issue with bringing in a UBI is simply it’s enormous cost. Should the UK utilise UBI on Yang’s terms, paying every adult £1000/month, this would roughly amount to a <a href=\"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/could-universal-basic-income-help-17953411\">£50bn/month bill for the governmen</a>t. Whilst some conservatives would argue that this could be made up by cancelling other benefits, leaving UBI as the only financial support available- there are other, better ways of finding the money. As UBI proponent <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/can-universal-basic-income-fix-the-coronavirus-crisis\">Guy Standing</a> argues, tax breaks given to the wealthy and corporations “cost the public exchequer £430 billion per year. You have all the money there.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/04/unconditional-basic-income-coronavirus-pandemic-crisis\">Those on the left</a> also argue that we should be wary of declaring UBI to be the saviour of humanity. The risk of wealthy elites using the implementation of UBI to allow them to sacrifice any other forms of financial support is abundantly clear, and there will be serious issues over what people are going to do with their time if all forms of work are phased out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/hK6WFyQQT3OPfHh3D24m71mUQ_FCuovTjsvXTkuWGYU37NvDohqa0ukl_gGUCNzbN6mQyO4LOykc_f8XQngX_wV5HW-oeynhY1oHHxWXAaWLp4JUC0TvgqGyVXsUSo6sdG7w6A98\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, this current pandemic, and the need to rapidly reduce employment has made UBI an essential short-term fix, and it should be introduced as soon as possible in order to provide urgent support for the millions who need it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is currently a <a href=\"https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/a-universal-basic-income-can-help-us-recover-from-covid-19-the-government-must-act-now\">petition</a> circulating which contains the signatures of over 110 MP’s and Peers from the Labour Party, SNP, Liberal Democrats and others- which I would strongly encourage people to sign, alongside emailing your local MP and imploring them to raise this issue in Parliament. In short, it is the best option we have to help out those who are currently struggling financially, and those who soon will be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further Reading:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to know more about UBI, automation and the future of work- here a few great long reads that will explain things in further detail:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/19/post-work-the-radical-idea-of-a-world-without-jobs\">https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/19/post-work-the-radical-idea-of-a-world-without-jobs</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.world-psi.org/sites/default/files/documents/research/en_ubi_full_report_2019.pdf\">http://www.world-psi.org/sites/default/files/documents/research/en_ubi_full_report_2019.pdf</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/04/unconditional-basic-income-coronavirus-pandemic-crisis\">https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/04/unconditional-basic-income-coronavirus-pandemic-crisis</a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-link is-provider-longreads\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<a href=\"https://longreads.com/2019/09/26/what-should-universal-basic-income-look-like/\">What Should Universal Basic Income Look&nbsp;Like?</a>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Glyn Sheldon </em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211;

Widespread shop closures and the decreased demand for luxury fashion has dealt a significant blow to sales across the industry. Therefore, fashion houses have turned their attention to the production and supply of the necessary support in the UK. With the continuous influx of coronavirus news filling our screens and dominating conversation, it can be hard to process all the information. So I thought I would do a bit of research and round up some of the responses by British brands to the pandemic so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Burberry</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The herald of British brands, Burberry has reported an 80% decline in sales due to the effects of Covid-19. In a statement, they revealed that they will pause production in their Yorkshire factory, best known for the creation of the classic trench coat, and use this space to manufacture hospital gowns and masks for the NHS. In turn, this would enable fast tracking of 100,000 surgical masks to NHS hospitals, help fund vaccine research at Oxford University and instigate donations to food poverty charities such as FareShare and The Felix Project.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-RltARgtT2/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

In order to create the medical-grade scrubs, the brand has brought in new machinery and uses NHS-approved fabrics. Managing director Jonathan Baker commenting, “We believe compassion is key to overcoming this historic hurdle, and we hope all employees of the National Health Service are able to feel truly appreciated for all their hard work. In turning our hand to the production of scrubs, we hope to do our bit in expressing that gratitude.” 4,000 medical scrubs are in process now and soon to be on the frontline.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Barbour</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Barbour has also turned their efforts to support those on the front line. They started by manufacturing disposable gowns for the Royal Vitoria Infirmary in Newcastle, the first hospital to deal with patients with the virus. They are now looking to increase production to provide scrubs for as many NHS workers in the north east as possible. Margaret Barbour explains, “The factory where we normally make our classic wax jackets is no stranger to adaptation. During both World Wars, we turned the factory over to make military garments to assist the war effort. We are pleased to once again be able to make a difference and this time, to support the NHS.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may only highlight the particular efforts of three British brands, however there has been widespread reaction within the fashion industry, with brands across the nation turning their focus to support. Let’s hope when we come out the other side of this crisis, and sales begin to soar once more, British fashion brands can look back with admiration at their efforts to pitch in and support their loyal customers, in a time when they needed it most. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>by Annabel Rodick </em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/annabelrodick/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6d9addfa1f255d42b5aa03d2a17d8dc0?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Annabel Rodick\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/annabelrodick/\">Annabel Rodick</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Sounds about right. You want something new, something quirky and unique, something that makes you remember what life was like before a pandemic and most importantly, something that not EVERYBODY has seen. My slightly shameful obsession with YouTube (if you know, you know) has lead me from the deep pits of the website right to this point, I am merely a messenger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In all seriousness, I feel as though YouTube does not get the credit it deserves. It is the only platform in the world which allows content from all walks of life to be shared free of charge, generating different perspectives for viewers, showcasing unknown aptitude and for the most part are not hindered by corporate restrictions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, like almost anything, it can and has been exploited, but that hasn’t stopped some absolutely tremendous content being published exuberating positivity alongside honesty – something I think we can all agree we are lacking at the moment. Talent and creativity in YouTube’s case is hiding in plain sight, and I’m here to show you! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have compiled a list of 5 videos/channels (all will be linked) which I feel are hidden gems, and upon reflection of this article’s success, I can add more (because trust me, I have more…).</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">300 days alone – Xavier Rosset</span></strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong><em>A man ahead of his time considering the current situation?</em></strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of my 3am classics, whilst I’m 2 hours into a healthy YouTube session wondering how on earth I’ve ended up watching Amber and Kem’s 2018 love island story for the 4<sup>th</sup> time (I have no shame at this point). But as they say, you have to sift through the stones to find the gold, and this number popped up in my suggested on the right. As usual, I clicked and sub-consciously decided I would watch 2-3 minutes before clicking off. 52 minutes later and I’m still watching. I could write a summary for you, but I feel as though his is better:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“To tame a wild pig or build a shelter, Xavier Rosset, the Swiss Robinson Crusoe, spent 10 months in 2008 on the remote, uninhabited Pacific island of Tofua, armed only with a machete, Swiss army knife and a camera. It is perhaps the truest story between solitude and loneliness”</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Surviving off the land, battling with intense boredom and doing almost anything to keep his mind occupied, follow this nutter’s journey from start to finish below (I don’t want to give too much away!)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"300 Days alone...\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/leHb2hdCLqo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Locked in my body – BBC3</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong><em>Homage, as always, to the incredible health workers the UK is so lucky to have.&nbsp;</em></strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, BBC3’s YouTube channel actually has lots of great content, from documentary series’ to interesting interviews so do check it out. This documentary short follows Terry Newbury, a healthy 30-year-old man who after contracting a seemingly harmless common cold, falls ill with the incredibly rare ‘Guillain Barre syndrome’, a disorder in which your immune system attacks your nerves. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Left totally paralyzed, Terry’s mind and senses continue to work normally, meaning he is living a human’s true worst nightmare of being literally locked in his body, but able to completely understand what’s going on around him. From being totally unable to communicate and open his eyes, and a seemingly impossible road to a full recovery being almost inevitable, watch Terry fight his way back to becoming himself again.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n <iframe title=\"Locked In My Body\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0k8sKX6IeMs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Bald and Bankrupt – Channel</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I, like many people, am a big introvert. This man is however, not. In fact, he could be the most extroverted person I have ever come across. Coming from England but being fluent in Russian, Bald (real name Ben) started his youtube channel back in 2018 after he trusted his business with an acquaintance who subsequently destroyed it, forcing him to file for bankruptcy, hence the name (and yes, he’s bald). His content is nothing short of unique, from exploring the forgotten villages and towns affected by the 1986 Chernobyl Disaster, to drinking vodka with Babushka’s in the still radioactive zones of Belarus, to smuggling a kitten out of Cuba back to Europe and hanging out with elders in the mountains of Dagestan (literally, just to name a few), it is easy to get lost in this man’s channel for hours, and rightly so. I have linked just one of his videos below, but please, explore his whole channel for yourself…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Return To The Last House In The Chernobyl  Zone 🇧🇾\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lbThP55CtoQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>YBS Youngblood’s &#8211; Channel</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I’m not usually jealous, but it is near impossible not to be jealous of this man’s lifestyle. This channel was a recent find of mine, and to put it shortly, is an Australian bloke who lives on the coast of Australia (literally paradise) with his dog Stryda. However, it is far more than that and I don’t think I’ve come across a bloke with a more infectious positive attitude. I suppose you would be when your job is to go spear fishing, shark swimming, jet skiing, whale spotting, baby turtle helping and BBQ’ing in crystal clear blue skies every day on your state of the art boat? His content is fantastic, and he comes across as a genuinely humble and good guy who appears to wake up thankful every day. If you’re looking for positivity, this is your channel…&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Isolating In The Deep Blue Fishing For Food Living From The Ocean - Ep 184\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tl06nH9zakk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>The Pizza Show – Munchies (Frank Pinello as host)</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Like BBC3, munchies have loads of great content to explore so once again, check it out. Start to finish, this is the definition of an easy watch. Host Frank Pinello, who owns a pizzeria in Brooklyn, goes around the world discussing and tasting the best pizza in existence. Although a simple idea, the likability of Frank makes the show so interesting due to his respectful attitude to other pizzeria owners, and the sheer passion and appreciation he has for pizza and the different ways it can be made. Top tip: do not watch it at 1am because you will be STARVING!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"The Pizza Show: NYC&#039;s Other Boroughs\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w6ffL3PJ2Og?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Luke Davies </em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/lukedavies/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/37b6cc9e3fd5615b51ee5575397c101a?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Luke Davies\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/lukedavies/\">Luke Davies</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

During the hard times, it’s unforgiving in its emotional turmoil and shows no remorse when your hopes of victory are crushed dramatically at the final hurdle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But cruelty is a necessary sporting beauty of its own, because without the low points, some of sport’s greatest moments of raw, unprecedented joy would simply cease to exist. Such moments of pure elation are rare, so we must cherish them at all costs and relive them when life throws us the opportunity to do so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to, dare I say it, Covid-19, it was unthinkable that anything could make the sporting calendar seem so insignificant, given that for so many of us, it’s the heartbeat of life as we know (or knew) it. However, the reality is such. I saw a remarkable but not surprising tweet last month which noted that every single professional football league in the world was under postponement. Astonishing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It does however offer us the rare luxury to reflect on the past decade of sport in this country, a decade that I’d argue was the most iconic in british sporting history. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in December, Sky Sports toyed with the idea of giving this iconic decade the highlight reel it deserved; a twitter poll on golf’s greatest comebacks, a 30 min ‘classics match’ on Sky Sports Cricket and a Premier League Years omnibus replacing the usual day-time drab. Inevitably, each quickly became sandwiched in the archives between the more pressing Paul Pogba January transfer rumour and the usual illegitimate pundits claiming Liverpool FC may never lose a game ever again.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with life, sport now advances at extraordinary speeds and the past decade pays testament to that; English football introduced the Video Assistant Referee (VAR), the England cricket team obliterated the ODI world record for runs in an innings (twice) and Team Sky raised the bar of global cycling to a new stratosphere. I could go on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, I’m horribly biased. The 2010’s was, after all, the first decade in which I can offer defensible commentary on. I like to think I was old enough to carefully dissect England’s dramatic performance at the 2003 Rugby World Cup Final, but as a 6 year old football fan, that’s a little far-fetched.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Opinions on ‘the greatest decade’ aside, I’m taking this opportunity to help you re-live seven of the most spectacular sporting moments of the 2010’s. Each of the following was, to my mind, undisputedly iconic. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Manchester City v QPR &#8211; 13/06/12.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For many, the greatest moment in English football history. When discussing this moment, it’s just common courtesy to raise the pitch of your voice and hold for at least 3 seconds at the end of Aguero’s name. After a generation in the shadow of United, Manchester City came back from the jaws of defeat to eclipse their fiercest rivals and claim their first Premier League title in 54 years. Stupendous.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Man City Win 2011/12 Premier League | Last 8 Minutes\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6I-MKxhjwQ4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Super Saturday, London 2012 &#8211; 04/08/12.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>London 2012 was special, really special. Over the course of the month-long games, memorable moments mounted up: 8 cycling golds, materful boxing from Nicola Adams, Brownlie brothers in arms on the podium. But if one night summed up that summer and epitomized our country’s spirit, it was ‘Super Saturday’. An ‘I was there’ moment for the 72,000 in attendance at the London stadium, a Saturday evening to top all Saturday evenings. The roar that carried Farah home in the 10,000m final to secure GB’s 3rd gold of the evening, following Ennis in the Heptathlon and Rutherford in the Long-jump, could be felt from all corners of the country. Super Saturday was a sporting day for the ages.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Mo Farah wins Olympics 10,000m gold for Great Britain\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c_KhRadTP5A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Miracle in Medinah &#8211; 30/09/12.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The title says it all. A sporting miracle unfolded on Sunday 30th September 2012 and Europe’s Ryder Cup team were the beneficiary. The final day of a Ryder Cup is always hot on the sporting calendar as a potential ‘classic’, but the miraculous events across the pond in 2012 were particularly captivating. Poulter, a man that revels in the beauty of Ryder Cup magic like no other, gave Europe a lifeline with a famous five birdie streak on the Saturday evening, setting the stage for a remarkable comeback from 10-6 down to claim glory on Sunday afternoon in Medinah. A Molinari putt sparked jubilant scenes, whilst captain Olazabal emotionally dedicated the win to the late, great Seve Ballesteros.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Review 2012 - Ryder Cup 2012\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PxFxhy2JNjM?start=172&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Leicester&#8217;s Premier League Campaign &#8211; 2015/16.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>5000/1 was probably a bad bet before the beginning of the 2015/16 season, such was the unlikelihood of a relegation-favourite lifting the Premier League trophy. But what followed was nothing short of unbelievable, this was the sporting underdog story of our generation and will be told for decades to come. An utterly inspiring sub-plot emerged too, ten goals in consecutive games sealed Vardy’s rise from Fleetwood grafter to Premier League record breaker, as he led the charge on the most remarkable campaign in football history. Bocelli’s spine-tingling performance of Nessun Dorma before Leicester lifted the trophy was a fitting end to the season that no english football fan will ever forget.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Andrea Bocelli performing Nessun Dorma and Con Te Partiro at Leicester\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BToNeL0SjVc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Anthony Joshua v Wladimir Klitschko &#8211; 29/04/17.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For many, this was the most anticipated heavyweight boxing fight in recent history, which then dramatically exceeded expectations. Heavyweight boxing was in a prolonged rut, the ‘classic encounters’ of years gone by had become a distant memory of the sorts you’d have to delve deep into archives to discover. Joshua v Klitschko felt real. A matchup in which the pendulum of dominance swung between the two titans, largely in the favour of the old guard, Klitschko, as AJ wobbled. Then came a Joshua entourage and a monstrous knockout to seal victory in the 11th, as pubs leapt to their feet across the nation. Finally, a proper heavyweight boxing classic.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Anthony Joshua v Wladimir Klitschko | Full Fight! | 29th April 2017\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RqcFZqtra3o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption><strong><em>ROUND 11 &#8211; 1:01:15. </em></strong></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>England&#8217;s World Cup Campaign &#8211; 2018</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It nearly came home, so it gets a mention. Whilst once again, it wasn&#8217;t the open bus parades, honorary knighthoods and BBC Sports Personality clean sweep we’d been desperately hoping for, this world cup gave us hope again. After the misery in 2010, capitulation in 2014 and with a former Middlesborough manager at the helm, expectations were unsurprisingly low. In true English fashion, things changed very quickly, a 6-0 group-stage win over Tunisia and we’d all but won the thing. As crushing as the defeat to Croatia was, this felt like a turning point for English football. Out with the WAGs and the scandals, in with the raw talent and exciting flamboyant youngsters. The future is undoubtedly bright. Come on England.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇨🇴 ENGLAND v COLOMBIA SHOOTOUT IN FULL | FIFA World Cup 2018 | ITV Sport\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8x-scKCKiCE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>England v New Zealand. Cricket World Cup Final &#8211; 14/07/19.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dubbed a ‘boring game’ by the uncultured, cricket throws up some of sports&#8217; most exhilarating spectacles at every level. In this instance, on the greatest stage of all, potentially the greatest limited-overs cricket match of all time unfolded. A fantastic 6-week tournament, boiled down to the final ball of the final over. Enough drama? Absolutely not. A super over followed, 12 balls to decide the fate of two of the world&#8217;s oldest cricketing nations. Needing 2 to win from the final ball, New Zealand scurried between the wickets to race back for a second run, but England held their nerve. Jos Butler’s outstretched hand swept through the stumps to win England the World Cup by the finest of margins. Superlatives don’t do this one justice.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"England Win CWC After Super Over! | England vs New Zealand - Highlights | ICC Cricket World Cup 2019\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kwu1yIC-ssg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Oliver Kriskinans</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/oliverkriskinans/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a6d50d7b8b07b86bf001b346a1783385?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Oliver Kriskinans\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/oliverkriskinans/\">Oliver Kriskinans</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

I remember he was on Mariah Carey’s Cribs episode once and a random cameo in Friends. As a kid, I saw him as a kind of friendly genius, his company name was everywhere but he wasn’t a normal businessman, he had a flowy shirt and a big smile. He was to me what Elon Musk thinks he is now to everyone. But he wasn’t.&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Branson has been one of the top targets for stick during Corona season. He was one of the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-04-02/richard-branson-bailout\" target=\"_blank\">first business owners to publicly ask for help</a> from the government, which when you’re worth £4.7bn it’s easy for people to think you’re taking the piss. There was then the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.leamingtoncourier.co.uk/read-this/virgin-atlantic-asking-staff-take-8-weeks-unpaid-leave-due-coronavirus-2456875\" target=\"_blank\">“staff to work for 8 weeks unpaid”</a> announcement which still sounds kind of unbelievable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine sitting across him at his golden desk and he asks you that. “Oh, go on, you can manage.” What was finally agreed was workers would have to take eight weeks of unpaid leave over the next three months, with the cost spread over six months&#8217; salary. Hard work to manage but a welcomed difference to losing your job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot has been said about him being able to pay for all this himself. We can do the sums; I’ve done the sums. 8571 employees at Virgin Airlines, 100 quid-ish a week, 8 weeks. £6,856, 800. Branson explained in his open letter that he can’t just go the cash machine and get billions out but even if he has a tenth of his worth available down the back of the sofa? This would amount to him using less than 2% of his ‘fleible income.’ To fund his own company, remember.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"634\" height=\"437\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VA1-e1587823371150.jpeg?resize=634%2C437&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-762\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VA1-e1587823371150.jpeg?w=634&amp;ssl=1 634w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VA1-e1587823371150.jpeg?resize=300%2C207&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://twitter.com/richardbranson/status/1252160127945359367\" target=\"_blank\">While we’re on the letter</a> we may as well stick with why this has posed a dilemma for me. It’s because I actually quite liked it. I read it and went back to that kid that thought he seemed like a nice bloke &#8211; better than your average billionaire. He’s doing it to save all these jobs and the socialist on my shoulder says this is important. He explains how he has helped the NHS in the past,<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/finance/city/1271766/virgin-richard-branson-nhs-legal-virgin-care-coronavirus-spt\" target=\"_blank\"> the truth behind why he felt forced to ‘sue’ them</a> and they’re helping with the construction of ventilators and PPE. Plus look at his lovely smile, he looks so friendly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;How funny would it be if this island became some kind of government expense because Branson missed a couple of payments?&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>A big winner for me was the loan vs grant exception. He’s not asking for free money; he understands he needs to pay it back and <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/20/business/virgin-australia-richard-branson/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">he’s even offering up some collateral</a>. How funny would it be if this island became some kind of government expense because Branson missed a couple of payments? I think the details of this loan would need to be made public and if he pays interest on it, like any other business would in times of hardship, it might be worth the risk. There’s a lot of if’s and buts involved and it’s whether the government has the cahonies to follow through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as this, the letter, in itself, struck me as weirdly honourable. Branson is absolutely Brewstied but he’s a beggar to the likes of Zuckerberg and Bezos and they don’t get any stick. This is, of course, because he’s British and close enough to hit with our metaphorical stick but he falls into the same anti-tax group as the big boys. The rule for these guys is keep your head down and count the money, addressing the situation is against protocol. So, for speaking out and explaining his situation, in a twisted way, I respect him.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;In his eyes, his bank balance is separate to Virgin’s, but in the public’s, they will always be intertwined&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>He is a businessman at the end of the day. He is a very good businessman who is doing his uttermost to ensure he doesn’t take a hit for his business’ rough patch. In his eyes, his bank balance is separate to Virgin’s, but in the public’s, they will always be intertwined. As well as this, say he did drop that 7 million, even if that is a fraction of his wealth it is still 7 million – a lot of money. Some people never get to the point where they realise they’re capable to stop being a tight arse.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, in many ways this letter really did help me empathise with the mind of Richard Branson. I can now at least see where he’s coming from and I’m glad he’s starting the dialogue rather than reacting angrily to his criticism. But (not going to suck up to him that much am I) he’s still taking the piss really.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I live on Necker because I love the BVI” so it’s just a happy coincidence it allows you to not pay into the public pot. It doesn’t matter if the 8 weeks unpaid was “virtually unanimously” agreed upon, if you give someone the choice of eating their own shit or jumping off a cliff, they’re going to have smelly breath. And it’s his bloody company, they are HIS responsibility. Failing all that he’s got a cheek asking for help anyway after saying the British government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jun/22/richard-branson-attacks-british-airways\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8220;would be better to wait for its demise&#8221;</a> when talking about British Airways making losses only 10 years ago. Yes, the situation is different but don’t fly planes in glass houses and all that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I keep changing my mind. I’ll probably write another status about the bloke tomorrow praising his humility bla bla bla but at the end of the day the angry socialist on my shoulder is winning this argument. And he’s telling me if you don’t pay your taxes you don’t get the kind of help from the system.

Especially in London, the capital of contagion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it was first announced on Monday 23rd March that the situation had officially got ‘slightly out of hand’, and anywhere beyond your own bedroom was an infectious death trap, we were a bit perturbed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simple acts once so effortlessly taken for granted, such as buying a turnip, exchanging salutations with the postman and engaging in other alfresco endeavours, mutated overnight into a crescendo of horror and suspicion. Office buildings turned their suited workers away, retail stores followed suit and soon Oxford Street, Piccadilly Circus and Canary Wharf were all eerily unoccupied.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before Doomsday, those that had worn face-masks were assumed to be hypochondriacs or certified bat-munchers, and subsequently tutted-at in the streets. Now it seems like rocking some form of PPE is probably the morally right thing to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly three weeks of wading through the quarantine quagmire and it is nigh-on impossible to recall what other sporting pursuits existed before the pedal and jog. Yet joyfully, this has got some Londoners moving.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most Londoners usually blame the stony concrete for curtailing their yearning for a nourishing jog. Now many find themselves bounding down the streets desperate to find any alibi to get out the house. When the long-term shock of all this bounding comes afoot, those that made a timely investment into the shin-splint industry might find themselves quids in. Just a thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Profiteering aside, there have been some extremely positive developments in the capital as a result of the virus. All people, regardless of race, nation, colour or creed are provided at all times with their own expansive Zorb-esque space bubble to reside in merrily, unfettered by the haunting memory of the subterranean armpit asphyxiation that was the morning commute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Londoners have developed stupendous manners. They wait patiently at the door of their local supermarkets, bequeathing their neighbour unencumbered access to the last remaining tins of horseradish. They pause graciously for one-and-other whilst passing in the street, often bowing as a sign of respect.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Traffic lights (those that haven’t been furloughed yet) blink joyfully in celebration of the empty roads.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, crossing the road at a zebra-crossing can truly be described as a soothing pastime, even for the geriatric. Traffic lights (those that haven’t been furloughed yet) blink joyfully in celebration of the empty roads. As do the stars, visible once more, above this great city.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps most impressively, for the first time since its introduction in the late Eighteen Century, the double-decker bus arrived on time. That momentous occasion was immortalised with a heart-warming round of applause that rippled throughout the city. This sort of regal veneration for the humble omnibus, and those brave health workers on the frontline, must carry on if there is ever a return to normality.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"425\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/LONDON.jpeg?resize=640%2C425&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-744\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/LONDON.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/LONDON.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/LONDON.jpeg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/LONDON.jpeg?resize=150%2C100&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/LONDON.jpeg?w=1506&amp;ssl=1 1506w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/LONDON.jpeg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>For a city that is so vast and populous, even in peacetime many feel isolated and lonely in the Big Smoke. So how wonderful it is, that when forced into our locality, many communities are coming together. Terrifyingly, people are even conversing with their neighbours for the first time, whilst clumsily upholding the social distancing dogma in true British style.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So perhaps, when the shell-shocking headlines are proved right and three weeks quarantine turns into three months or longer, this news won’t be greeted with civil unrest and revolutionary pandemonium, but with something akin to relief.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Relief, that we don’t have to re-join the queues onto the Northern Line or go anywhere near Finsbury Park. Relief, that we can actually have time to speak to our loved ones and friends. Relief, that we can see the stars, cross the road in peace and converse with our neighbours, sometimes all at the same time. If all else fails, at least we can rely on the eternal sunshine of the British Summer to keep our spirits up.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Caspar Barnes</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" rel=\"http://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/ \">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/casparbarnes/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/451c66e4edc94eef5ca562047168c717?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Caspar Barnes\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/casparbarnes/\">Caspar Barnes</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Primarily, The British Fashion Council have announced they will be running a gender-neutral fashion week on digital platforms from June 12<sup>th</sup>. Under normal circumstances, this date was scheduled for Men’s LFW, consisting of exclusive catwalk shows, presentations, events and designer showrooms. Under the new digital format, senior figures within the fashion council are hoping the week will help promote inclusivity in the industry and crucially, we will be able to stream live from our kitchen table! Perfect, if you ask me. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-3.png?resize=532%2C359&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-754\" width=\"532\" height=\"359\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><em>Each year Flaunter.com takes part in filming and shooting behind the scenes at Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Australia. This photograph was captured backstage at Strateus Carlucci in 2017 by Flaunter</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The details of the digital LFW agenda are, at the moment, unclear, but it will obviously be relative to what the designer can produce under the constraints of isolation. So, expect anything from a virtual look book to a podcast.&nbsp;Caroline Rush, the chief executive of the British Fashion Council, said in a release, “by creating a cultural fashion week platform, we are adapting digital innovation to best fit our needs today and something to build on as a global showcase for the future. Designers will be able to share their stories, and for those that have them, their collections, with a wider global community; we hope that as well as personal perspectives on this difficult time, there will be inspiration in bucket-loads. It is what British fashion is known for.”</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-2.png?resize=261%2C176&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-753\" width=\"261\" height=\"176\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><em>Each year Flaunter.com shoots images on the streets and behind the scenes at Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Australia.

Whilst the Fashion industry has also been forced into a period of slow down, it has also been granted  a period of reflection to think twice about levels of consumption and the number of shows. Last week, designer Marc Jacobs argued that it was only necessary to have two shows a year. “The amount of stuff we make and the quantity we make and the amount of time it’s shown – it’s just so excessive,” he told the Vogue Global Conversations webinar. Traditionally, there are four London fashion weeks a year, February and September fashion weeks for women’s; January and June fashion weeks for men’s. So, will a more gender fluid approach continue to filter through the industry and change the structure we&#8217;re accustomed to?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though cities such as Shanghai and Moscow have used a more digital focus to their fashion weeks during the pandemic, London will be the first city to entertain a solely digital fashion week from start to finish. Whilst this presents a huge challenge for organisers and designers, London has the chance to change the wold’s perception and make a long-lasting difference. According to WWD (Women&#8217;s Wear Daily), the British Fashion Council are hoping to maintain its four annual live events &#8211; how will these be executed? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only time will tell, and in truth, we will have to wait until September for S/S 21 to properly reflect on the changes. Undoubtedly, June London Fashion Week 2020 will be one to remember, with a real focus upon innovation and social awareness. Have you always wanted to go to a fashion show and attend the exclusive designer presentations? Have you always wanted to see what it is like to have a spot on that front row?  If so, 2020 is your year. For full access, all you need is a reliable internet connection! So if you&#8217;re up to speed with the latest broadband, June&#8217;s LFW week will be just a couple of clicks away, and you&#8217;ve got the best seat in the house&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Annabel Rodick </em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/annabelrodick/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6d9addfa1f255d42b5aa03d2a17d8dc0?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Annabel Rodick\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/annabelrodick/\">Annabel Rodick</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

South Korean offices and shopping centres are gradually filling up again. Wuhan has been out of lockdown for a week and the wet markets are brimming with life. Chinese horseshoe bats have succeeded in their campaign and are now off the menu. Huzzah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, with the eruption of furloughs in the United Kingdom and likely unemployment tsunami that will follow, Britain is in for a spot of bother.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, 11 million people in the UK have been furloughed or let go, which equates to up a third of the workforce. Being unemployed has never been so in vogue. Even Condé Nast (Vogue’s parent company) is laying people off. No one is safe from being pleasured with a pay cut, furlough or redundancy. Unless, of course, you managed to make the bizarre career move of accepting a job at Andrex, the canine lavatory paper manufacturer. Then you’ll be rolling in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;This is a perfect time to plan your escape&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In all the redundancy panic, many people have forgotten that they never really liked their job in the first place. This is a perfect time to plan your escape.&nbsp;With the Chancellor of the Exchequer and certified hottie Rishi “Dishy Rishi”<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-rishi-sunak-promises-to-guarantee-330bn-loans-to-business\"> Sunak promising to prop up the UK economy </a>with £330bn of business loans, now might be as good a time as any to go your own way. So, take the money and run. Start your app or start manufacturing lightsabre-themed condoms or start a business that designs <em>doggles</em> (sunglasses for hip Huskies) and sequined vejazzles for the cat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The silver lining of corona is that people are slowing down and flexing their creative muscles. The exponential growth in online orders for trumpets, baking powder and Brown Ochre oil paint stands as testament to this. The actor Idris Elba (who tested positive with his newly-wed wife) even praised the unifying power of quarantine and suggests it should become an annual recurring event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With many countries now taking their first tentative steps back towards the status quo, we could find ourselves racing towards the quarantine finish line sooner than we thought.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, make the most of the best aspects of isolation (moments to reflect, reading that book you actually picked up and quality time with your loved ones) whilst you still have them.&nbsp;Whatever you do, do not, under any circumstances, condemn your life’s work to the drudgery of manufacturing bog roll.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Caspar Barnes</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/casparbarnes/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/451c66e4edc94eef5ca562047168c717?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Caspar Barnes\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/casparbarnes/\">Caspar Barnes</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

I remember necking tequilas at midnight, snogging my mates and promising ourselves that 2020 would be <em>THE</em> year. My writing partner and I had bagged five stars for our debut play <em>‘Belly Up’</em>, we were heading to the Underbelly at Edinburgh Fringe, and things had started taking off on my Hinge profile… (still waiting on that reply Adam, no hard feelings). Fast forward four months and, like many, I’ve used a sock as loo roll, I’m back at my rents and I’ve started having erotic fantasies about Joe Exotic (side note- I am aggressively against the entrapment of big cats).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I struggle to write at the best of times. Firstly, because I’m primarily an actress. And secondly, I’m not one of those kooky legends who can perch in a cafe and spit tremendous bars that shred modern politics and provide future foresight through speculative visual fiction over an oat flat white. I’m the type who’s up at 5am, pacing the flat, squeezing out a short story about a sex-starved nun. It’s ugly, it’s painful and 9/10 it’s a pile of s*** scribbled on the back of a waitressing notepad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing is a luxury. Having the time to sit at home and spend hours upon hours indulging your imagination is a privilege. So it’s incredibly annoying when you finally have nothing but time and nothing is coming out. I can only compare it to one of Joe Exotic’s tigers finally being released into the wild but quickly breaking two legs in quick succession and developing agoraphobia. In fact, time all of a sudden becomes the enemy. It’s an<br>endless stress of emptiness and fear of Zoom calls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If writing right now is the last thing on your mind then that is absolutely fair enough. I read a tweet a few weeks ago stating that you’re a psychopath if you’re able to write right now. I repeat this to myself in the mirror daily. However, if you fancy giving it a crack in these hard times, here’s a few things I’ve tried in order to relieve the blockage.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1)</strong> Watch Netflix. Watch Unorthodox and bathe in the cinematography. Watch Thunder Road, Joe Swanberg’s Easy and #BlackAF &#8211; all three are a masterclass in painfully naturalistic, complex characters. Watch live streams of theatre shows, get a 7 day free trial of mubi.com, in fact get free trials on all streaming platforms, make a new email and register again. Just by watching you’re taking in heaps, observe other artist’s work- learn from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2)</strong> Watch Tim Minchin’s 9 Life Lessons on Youtube. I want to marry this man and his words. “Be micro-ambitious and see what happens as you pursue short-term goals…” Walk to the fridge and back, be MICRO ambitious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3) </strong>Perhaps now is the time to share some work with friends and family members who have a spare sec to read it. Roll around in their praise, lap it up. Your biggest fans are those who are genetically programmed to lie to you. Thank you DNA you two-faced bastard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4)</strong> Don’t be in a rush to create. I went into lock down swearing I would emerge with an Olivier award winning play under my belt and a six pack. In the words of Tim Minchin (stop thinking about Tim Minchin) “Don’t be in a rush to succeed. It might come at a cost”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5)</strong> Read about the boring stuff. Always feared structure and form like me? Start tucking in hunny. Nick Hern’s website has a 30% discount code right now, if you have the cash buy Stephen Jeffrey’s ‘Playwriting’ and ‘Being a Playwright’ By Chris Foxon and George Turvey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6)</strong> Exercise. Won’t dwell on that one </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7)</strong> Start a book club! We’ve miraculously failed as a bar team to keep this one up, but it was fun while it lasted. All read a play once a week and discuss on Zoom. Or read a play together over Zoom, a few of us actors got together and read Holes &#8211; it’s a good play. There’s loads of resources on Instagram as well, check out Daisy May Cooper’s live writing sessions, Rupi Kaur does them as well. They’re half an hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8)</strong> Be thankful for the reasons you find creativity easy when you’re not confined to a room. A lot of my characters are based on people I’ve served at work, people on public transport or colleagues I’ve met doing weird freelance jobs. I hate the underground but I’m craving the endless stream of character ideas. I’m grateful for my mates and their support, I can’t wait to squeeze them and poison them with my sweet potato curry. Things I took for granted like walking down Brixton Hill and having an hours stand up<br>comedy sesh with my writing partner Lydia, I want to frame these moments and make a shrine for of all the legends who inspire me- do something weird with candles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9)</strong> Let your thoughts flow. Sit down with a pen and paper and do a ‘stream of consciousness’ for fifteen minutes. Don’t edit yourself. And when you get stuck repeat the previous sentence until you can move on. You never know what little gems lie in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10) </strong>Be kind to yourself. Ignore the fact Shakespeare apparently wrote King Lear in lock down. Did he even write half his plays? I’m allowed to say that, I’m from his birth town. If you can write a shopping list, that’s an achievement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are things I am trying to do myself, so they’re by all means not the ‘correct’ way to alleviate stress surrounding lack of creativity. Right now, the main priority is keeping sane and healthy. I’m just someone who, like many creatives, had a project just about to go somewhere and suddenly found it’s all ground to a halt. It’s gutting. BUT I want to look back on this period and go, actually I’m glad I had that pause in life… because I might not have got a six pack and an Olivier award winning play under my belt, but I had a good crack at it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"9 Life Lessons - Tim Minchin UWA Address\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yoEezZD71sc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Julia Grogan</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/juliagrogan/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/17c03cea9788795b021d8e0a9474342b?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Julia Grogan\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/juliagrogan/\">Julia Grogan</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Now I know that putting on a podcast for your commute from your bedroom to your kitchen / front room / back room / newly appointed office might actually take longer than the duration of said commute but we still have our daily exercise allowance &#8211; a time I like to go on a walk, plug in my earphones and shut off from all the news. Below are my favourite storytelling podcasts that will make you walk that little bit further just so you can hear what happens next. All are based on true stories which makes them all the more astounding. In no particular order…</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>1. <strong>Tunnel 29 &#8211; 10 episodes, 15 mins each</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly I listened to all of this in one sitting &#8211; it is that good. Based on interviews with courageous men and women who escaped through a tunnel underneath the Berlin Wall from East Germany you are left in utter admiration for the people that endured such living conditions. The piecing together of evidence from Stasi archives and the escapees themselves sets for a thoroughly gripping listen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>2. <strong>The Missing Cryptoqueen &#8211; 10 episodes, 40 mins each</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>No need to have any prior knowledge of cryptocurrencies to get hooked by this one. Journalist Jamie Bartlett digs into the rise of Dr Ruja Ignatova who was set to make millions of people rich &#8211; and then she disappeared. At the time of release in October 2019 new information was being unearthed. Here’s hoping for a second season!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B2orLWBntig/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

I had never heard of the 39 people in Heaven’s Gate who took their lives in 1997 in an apparent mass suicide. The host interviews a variety of people touched by the cult and helps you understand just how easy it could have been to join such a group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>4. <strong>Fake Heiress &#8211; 7 episodes, 35 mins each</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can stomach the voice of the actress playing Anna Delvey then you are in for a ride. A fascinating tale, expertly acted, of the ins and outs of high society New York and the art of manipulation. You simultaneously admire and detest this woman’s knack for getting exactly what she wants.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>5. <strong>The Teacher’s Pet &#8211; 18 episodes, 40 mins &#8211; 2 hours each</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is another podcast that was released in real-time in which an ongoing investigation found new evidence on an unsolved 36 year old cold case. Hedley Thomas, a journalist from The Australian makes it his mission to bring justice to a woman that went missing without a trace &#8211; or so it seems.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>6. <strong>Caliphate &#8211; 10 episodes, 20 &#8211; 30 mins each</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I learnt a lot from this podcast by The New York Times journalist, Rukmini Callimachi. Her amazingly skilled storytelling attempts to do something that many of us couldn’t even fathom: understand ISIS. I suggest listening to this in tandem with someone else as it brings with it so many thoughts, feelings and opinions that you’ll just need to share them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>7. <strong>The Drop Out &#8211; 6 episodes, 40 mins each</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos was the youngest self-made female billionaire &#8211; pretty inspirational right? Perhaps not… her promise to transform the face of healthcare wasn’t without its repercussions. Interviews with those who were closest to her reveal a very dark story indeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Philippa Strahan</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/philippastrahan/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e423878383e412b23d8a42546957320d?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Philippa Strahan\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/philippastrahan/\">Philippa Strahan</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Hundreds of thousands of people around the world are dying, we can’t go outside and, as an added bonus, the economy is essentially <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/04/03/coronavirus-economic-crash-way-worse-2008-crisis-12506742/\" target=\"_blank\">going to be fucked </a>up beyond all recognition.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">This state-of-affairs certainly may not seem like the ideal time to jump head-first into any political pursuits. We are still being told, largely by members of the right-wing media, that we should refrain from <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1257815/coronavirus-uk-labour-john-mcdonnell-boris-johnson-political-football-covid-19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">‘politicising’ the current crisis</a> for generally undefined reasons.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst political point-scoring for the sake of it is admittedly not particularly useful at this point in time, neither is this the time to refrain from political activity altogether. Instead, as there’s little else to occupy us for the foreseeable future and with a lot on the line, the lockdown period is in fact a perfect opportunity to effect positive change both during and after the Coronavirus crisis.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For starters, there are some serious problems with the way the government is handling Covid-19 which, if fixed, could achieve drastically better results for the country than the current forecasts are suggesting. On the issue of PPE for example, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YouGov/status/1249753063348490240?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">in a recent YouGov poll</a> (see below), 61% of Doctors said they had inadequate, or not enough, PPE, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YouGov/status/1248243298092961793?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">whilst 37% of Doctors said</a> they were having to treat patients both with and without Covid-19 which obviously presents a serious health risk to the patients, the Doctors and their families. Although several members of the government have repeatedly stated that solving this is <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-sets-out-plan-for-national-effort-on-ppe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a ‘priority’</a>, things still clearly aren’t moving fast enough with each passing day further exacerbating the spread of the crisis.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">16 million pieces of personal protective equipment were delivered to hospitals over bank holiday weekend, Dominic Raab has revealed. <br><br>Last week only one in seven NHS workers (14%) told us they have the correct protective equipment in good supply<a href=\"https://t.co/ePVWdUGKoL\">https://t.co/ePVWdUGKoL</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/I0GLpPo8P5\">pic.twitter.com/I0GLpPo8P5</a></p>&mdash; YouGov (@YouGov) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YouGov/status/1249753063348490240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 13, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div><figcaption><strong><em>Source: Twitter. @YouGov.</em></strong></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/02/asia/coronavirus-drive-through-south-korea-hnk-intl/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">South Korea</a>, which has dealt with the crisis better than perhaps any other country in the world- healthcare staff are covered head-to-toe in Hazmat suits which drastically reduce the spread of infection. Our NHS staff have resorted to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52145140\" target=\"_blank\">covering themselves in bin-bags</a>, an absolute disgrace which our Government has allowed to happen by not preparing fast or hard enough and has certainly led to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/11/matt-hancock-reveals-deaths-of-19-nhs-workers-amid-ppe-row\" target=\"_blank\">the unnecessary deaths of several</a> frontline workers. Therefore pressure and effective scrutiny must be applied on the government to get this issue, as well as other problems regarding testing and provision of ventilators, solved as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Petitions such as <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/uk-govt-provide-ppe-to-all-frontline-nhs-to-keep-them-safe-coronavirus\">this one</a> must be signed and shared, emails/tweets must be sent to MP’s and Councillors demanding action, all to highlight the strength of feeling and force the Government to act. The Daily Mirror today launched a <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/voice-mirror-let-never-forget-21860972\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">further campaign</a> to demand the protection of our NHS heroes, hopefully leading to even stronger public support for a massive increase in PPE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NHS-1.jpeg?resize=325%2C395\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-344\" width=\"325\" height=\"395\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NHS-1.jpeg?w=712&amp;ssl=1 712w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NHS-1.jpeg?resize=247%2C300&amp;ssl=1 247w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><em>&#8220;Throughout the past few weeks it has been great to witness the sense of pride and admiration amongst the public towards our vital NHS staff.&#8221;</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the past few weeks it has been great to witness the sense of pride and admiration amongst the public towards our vital NHS staff. But right now we can’t afford to let this simply be a cosmetic show of support. We need concrete activity to provide them with much-needed help. Despite the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/now-not-time-discuss-pay-21816787\" target=\"_blank\">claims of some Tory </a>ministers, now is in fact the perfect time to reward our most-necessary key workers with a pay rise to at least make their current situation a tad more bearable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have already been tangible victories as a result of public action during this crisis. The Government initially introduced the necessary lockdown and introduced a furlough scheme paying 80% of salaries after pressure from both the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/pressure-grows-boris-johnson-impose-uk-coronavirus-lockdown\" target=\"_blank\">public</a> and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51983086\" target=\"_blank\">opposition parties</a>. Subsequently, petitions were circulated demanding the self-employed received a similar  <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52044542\" target=\"_blank\">compensation package</a> and that <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52048632\" target=\"_blank\">parking charges for NHS staff </a>were scrapped &#8211; with both duly being dealt with by the Government.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Government will not do this on their own. Without wishing to get too party political, their ideology as small-c ‘conservatives’ will likely prevent them from spending money unless absolutely necessary. Despite a recent influx in spending in Rishi Sunak’s last budget, <a href=\"https://novaramedia.com/2020/03/13/austerity-is-not-over-and-coronavirus-will-prove-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">austerity is far from over</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though the current parliamentary majority is strong, as Boris said himself, these votes were <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/general-election-results-boris-johnson-labour-votes-brexit-a9245041.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">only ‘lent’ to the Tories</a> and it is certainly clear that the current Tory Government is aiming to expand their electoral coalition by pursuing popular policies. As such, the Government would be loath to refuse the demands of the public to protect key workers, wages and those most at risk from Covid-19.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lockdown-1.jpeg?resize=331%2C215\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-346\" width=\"331\" height=\"215\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lockdown-1.jpeg?zoom=2&amp;resize=331%2C215&amp;ssl=1 662w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lockdown-1.jpeg?zoom=3&amp;resize=331%2C215&amp;ssl=1 993w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><em>&#8220;The lockdown itself, frustrating as it is, must continue to be enforced at least until our health system becomes adequately prepared.&#8221;</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The lockdown itself, frustrating as it is, must continue to be enforced at least until our health system becomes adequately prepared. The Government initially wished to pursue their now infamous ‘herd immunity’ strategy with <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/22/no-10-denies-claim-dominic-cummings-argued-to-let-old-people-die\" target=\"_blank\">Dominic Cummings </a>reportedly saying: “if that means some pensioners die, too bad”. This was based on the idea that the British public are too freedom-loving and unresponsive to authority that they simply would not abide having to stay in their homes for months on end even if it means hundreds of thousands of Brits die. As evidenced by both <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-uk-lockdown-boris-johnson-poll-yougov-latest-a9420526.html\" target=\"_blank\">polling data</a> and general common sense, the government got this very wrong (and their delay in implementing the eventual lockdown has <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/coronavirus-johnson-s-libertarian-views-behind-hesitancy-lock-down-britain-n1164786\" target=\"_blank\">likely cost thousands of lives</a>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, simply sticking to the rules and encouraging others to do the same, is a political act in and of itself. Whilst public support for the lockdown remains high, the Government will keep it in place and lives will be saved. The public-blaming espoused by politicians and journalists alike allows the spotlight to be taken off those who actually have the responsibility for inaction and a significant loss of life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, by getting political- signing petitions on Facebook, writing to your MP, telling people to stay home, joining a mutual aid group- you can affect positive change. By forcing the Government to act quicker to protect the NHS, by helping out vulnerable others, and observing social distancing we will all be doing our part in preventing the worst effects of this crisis (and this is even without bringing up the inevitable side-effects of Covid-19 which deserve an article on their own).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have already seen that our actions can work. So get involved, organised and help save lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Glyn Sheldon </em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons aligncenter\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\"></a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/glynsheldon/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b6f4eedcc4559f94dd10458b659bb94a?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Glyn Sheldon\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/glynsheldon/\">Glyn Sheldon</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

That if you follow <em>their</em> regime, you will be a better person and be closer to some goal that <em>they</em> have set you. Listening to people speak from that position can be both annoying and degrading, and doesn’t engage us individually, so I will do my best to avoid it as I invite you to think differently.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is simply an outline of a couple of things that I have found to be incredibly helpful, particularly during this unprecedented COVID-19 era. Those two things are closely linked, but nonetheless separate. As you may have guessed from the title, one is cultivating productive and positive habits; the second is building these habits into a sustaining routine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s start with habits. Ancient Greek philosopher, Aristotle, famously placed huge importance on habits, suggesting that ‘<em>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit</em>’. Slightly cringe philosophical reference &#8211; sorry! &#8211; however, the point is pertinent. When we do something repeatedly, for an extended period of time, it becomes a part of who we are. If we do something often enough, it becomes engrained in us, and has an outward effect on what we do, say, think and feel. Meditation is a good example. Generic, I know. However, making a habit of meditating &#8211; that is, meditating every day for a long period of time, will impact your life. Just like, say, smoking every day and making a habit out of that will also impact your life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, just imagine your overall happiness is on a measurable scale of, say, 1 to 10. Every day you start at your baseline level, wherever that may be. Things you do can either increase or decrease your number on the scale. Obviously, we would want to do things that increase our number. The more we increase our number, the better we feel. It follows, then, that if we do things that make us feel good, often, it is likely our overall ‘happiness number’ will go up. That is to say, if we <em>make a habit </em>out of doing things that make us feel good, we will probably start to feel better in general. Seems obvious, right?! Truthfully, maintaining positive habits is harder than it would seem, and requires some conscientious effort &#8211; and a bit of initial discipline. This is where building a routine comes in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people live and die by a routine. Others choose to live more freely and let each day dictate itself. Neither is wrong &#8211; and it’s important to do what works best for you. However, I have found that if you build a routine based around positive habits, it’s noticeably easier to maintain said habits, and thus increase your <em>overall</em>wellbeing. Here’s why: once you have a clear, daily routine sorted, it <em>takes the thought process out of it. </em>There is no longer the question of: ‘How do I make time for this?’, which is the hardest part of keeping up a habit! A solid routine is the framework for maintaining habits and, I promise you, it makes them so much easier to keep up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-18-at-12.58.13.png?resize=310%2C228\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-503\" width=\"310\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-18-at-12.58.13.png?zoom=2&amp;resize=310%2C228&amp;ssl=1 620w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-18-at-12.58.13.png?zoom=3&amp;resize=310%2C228&amp;ssl=1 930w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><em>My personal habit tracker</em> </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To build a routine, I used a habit tracker. These are an amazingly simple way to hold yourself accountable for habits, and thus build a routine of them. You can find a good explanation and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.clementinecreative.co.za/reach-goals-free-printable-habit-tracker/\" target=\"_blank\">example of one here*</a>, and I will include a picture of another (right).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I start each day with three things that <em>I know</em> make me feel good. Yoga, journalling and the Wim Hof Method (see below). They are in my habit tracker. I do not think about doing them anymore, as they are simply my morning routine. Whilst they are still in process, they are on their way to becoming deeply engrained habits in my life. Simply put, doing things that make you feel good, more often, makes you feel good &#8211; more often &#8211; and therefore better overall. Please note that these things do not work for everybody. I would wholeheartedly recommend anybody try them, but we are all built differently and so what makes me feel good may not do the same for you; its a case of trial and error until you find what works!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Guided Wim Hof Method Breathing\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tybOi4hjZFQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption><strong><em>Wim Hof has set his followers a 40 day quarantine challenge consisting of &#8216;WMH breathing&#8217; and cold showers to help boost physical and mental health</em>.</strong></figcaption></figure>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the current situation, where all of us are on lockdown for the foreseeable future, now is a better time than ever to identify your <em>positive habits, prioritise them and base your daily routine around them. </em>Spending time working on my habits and working them into a routine has noticeably improved my own wellbeing and mental attitude. These things are very personal to each individual. However, I think everyone can benefit from developing their own positive habits by putting them into a routine, and I urge you to give it a go for &#8211; just a week &#8211; and see how you feel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Gabriel Godfrey-Janni</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/gabrielgodfreyjanni/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c13e5f76d411d9a704c182535e425a70?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Gabriel Godfrey-Janni\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/gabrielgodfreyjanni/\">Gabriel Godfrey-Janni</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Look around you right now. Granted they may not present you with the most idyllic vista, but they do allow for a degree of escapism. Windows allow our minds to drift into romantic reveries or deep contemplation. We look through windows to see alternative realities from those we are already surrounded by. In any life, being at the window is a common archetype where people spend time; the old person looking out, the prisoner in his cell, the astronaut in space, the traveller on a journey, the underwater explorer. These all support an idea of the window as a physical barrier that nonetheless connect us with the outside world.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-center is-style-default\"><p>&#8220;Trapped in our houses, like the figures in Hopper’s paintings, we stare out in a state of longing, waiting to embrace friends and family.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image1.jpeg?resize=262%2C208\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-363\" width=\"262\" height=\"208\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image1.jpeg?zoom=2&amp;resize=262%2C208&amp;ssl=1 524w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image1.jpeg?zoom=3&amp;resize=262%2C208&amp;ssl=1 786w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><strong>Edward Hopper</strong>, <em>Cape Cod Morning, </em>1950.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me introduce or perhaps reintroduce you to the American Realist painter Edward Hopper. Not named a realist for nothing, Hopper’s works are poignant and engaging. The widespread use of windows in his artworks has often gone unnoticed, yet they stand, for me, to be a prominent tool of connection for his figures. Painting isolated figures overlooking eerily empty cityscapes, Hopper uses the window as a threshold between an inside reality and an outside illusoriness. In a time of physical isolation, the Covid-19 pandemic has made the need for a connection more important than ever. Trapped in our houses, like the figures in Hopper’s paintings, we stare out in a state of longing, waiting to embrace friends and family. His paintings capture a crisis of loneliness for his figures; a fervent social consequence of this pandemic for some individuals. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image2-1.png?resize=323%2C270\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-364\" width=\"323\" height=\"270\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image2-1.png?zoom=2&amp;resize=323%2C270&amp;ssl=1 646w, https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image2-1.png?zoom=3&amp;resize=323%2C270&amp;ssl=1 969w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><strong>Edward Hopper</strong>, <em>Night Windows,</em> 1928</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>One of his paintings, <em>Night Windows, </em>1928, yields an alternative viewpoint for us to look at. Perhaps a sight for voyeuristic pleasure, a woman is being watched (by us) in a state of undress through her window. One might dismiss the accusation of Hopper’s prurient behaviour and instead sympathise with the social anxieties of the C20th woman as she tries to disrobe in private. Scenarios such as this are more likely to happen during our current state of lockdown. The unseen sadistic eyes that peer through windows at night; are they searching for something more profound or are they just grasping onto that one moment of daily connection? <em>Office in a Small City, </em>1953 additionally captures the ‘WFH’ status that many will identify with. Staring through his window towards a static skyline, will any work be completed by this figure?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is as if Hopper had foreseen the disconnected realities of what was to come today. We can now almost situate ourselves in the positions of these figures as we stare out or gaze into the windows of neighbouring buildings, waiting to be reconnected to the outside world. Fortunately, through the virtual windows of our phones and laptops, social media enables us to connect in ways that were not possible for Hopper’s subjects.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Jemima Erith</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons aligncenter\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/jemimaerith/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b9e50ec15e2f28fa6625526bc8ba351b?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Jemima Erith\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/jemimaerith/\">Jemima Erith</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Though our first thoughts must obviously be with preventing the spread of the virus, we should also be looking ahead to a potentially more serious crisis on the horizon.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://tribunemag.co.uk/2020/03/the-coming-debt-deluge\">Jerome Roos writes</a>, due to the mass shutdown of commercial activity and already record levels of debt within the system, Coronavirus “risks unleashing a major international debt crisis that will make the market crash and global recession of 2008–’09 look like child’s play”. Roos suggests the perfect storm of incredible levels of “surging global debt levels” and “sharp economic contraction”, is likely to pose an “existential threat” to the “debt-based financialised world economy”. This is certainly going to provide a massive challenge to states around the globe whenever this public health crisis eventually ends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Broadly speaking, there are two main theories of how to alleviate a financial crisis. These methods have been tried out by governments in different historical settings so we do have a bit of evidence from which to base our future choices on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the one hand we can look at the decisions made by the UK Government in response to the 2008 Financial crash. After the New Labour government had <a href=\"https://www-cdn.oxfam.org/s3fs-public/file_attachments/cs-true-cost-austerity-inequality-uk-120913-en_0.pdf\">bailed out the banks</a> to the tune of $141bn, Cameron and Osborne instituted an austerity regime with deregulation and drastic cuts to public sector wages and welfare services (whilst also reducing taxes on the rich and corporations). These policies had the stated aim of reducing the deficit and providing a balanced budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/london-2-1-1024x768.jpeg?resize=640%2C480\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-471\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/london-2-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/london-2-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/london-2-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/london-2-1.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/london-2-1.jpeg?w=1567&amp;ssl=1 1567w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/london-2-1.jpeg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><strong>&#8220;<em>The Tories claimed at the time that, despite the horrific effects, these were necessary measures that would help to save the economy and bring down the debt levels.</em>&#8220;</strong></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The effects of such policies were severe. Austerity has caused a huge rise in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/03/is-austerity-driving-people-to-food-banks-thats-an-easy-one\">food banks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/austerity-policies-lie-at-heart-of-soaring-homelessness-and-related-health-harms-argue-experts/\">homelessness</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/austerity-has-been-presented-as-a-necessary-evil-it-s-not-1-5085890\">child poverty</a> and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/employment-may-be-at-an-all-time-high-in-the-uk-but-austerity-low-pay-and-zero-hours-contracts-inflict-misery-on-millions-110252\">low wage, zero-hours jobs</a>, as well as being responsible for a mind-boggling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/01/perfect-storm-austerity-behind-130000-deaths-uk-ippr-report\">130,000 ‘preventable deaths’</a>. The Tories claimed at the time that, despite the horrific effects, these were necessary measures that would help to save the economy and bring down the debt levels. However, even without noting that these clearly damaging policies failed on their own terms (the budget has not been balanced and austerity has cost the state <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/blog/austerity-there-is-an-alternative-and-the-uk-can-afford-to-deliver-it\">over £100bn in terms of economic growth</a>), there was always another way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This ‘other way’ was practiced following the Wall Street Crash and Great Depression in the 1930’s. This period was marked by a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-keynesian-policy-led-economic-growth-in-the-new-deal-era-three-simple-graphs-2011-11?r=US&amp;IR=T\">‘vicious cycle’ </a>where “aggregate demand dropped a lot. People stopped buying things leading companies to reduce production and stop hiring, which in turn reduced how much people could buy”. Instead of simply reducing government spending and putting the cost of the crisis on the backs of the people least responsible for initiating the crisis, politicians such as President F.D. Roosevelt followed a more Keynesian approach to economic policy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general terms, Keynesian economics favours mass public spending as a method of stimulating the economy, creating jobs and demand in the process. This was pursued throughout the ‘New Deal’ period where organisations were created which put people to work on various infrastructure projects which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/21/100-years-on-another-great-depression-coronavirus-fiscal-response\">massively reduced unemployment and expanded the economy.&nbsp;</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the UK Government has a decision to make. The Tories, ideologically opposed to mass public spending programmes, could choose to once again punish the vulnerable during the upcoming economic crisis. They could continue their pattern of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/mar/23/very-selfish-matt-hancock-condemns-those-still-socialising-in-uk-video\">blaming the public</a> for ‘flouting the rules’ and argue that there is no other option but to, once again, cut public services and wages for our heroic key workers in public sector roles. Such a plan would, I believe, ring incredibly hollow in this Coronavirus era.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have already witnessed the Government finding their <a href=\"https://www.indy100.com/article/budget-tories-rishi-sunak-labour-magic-money-tree-twitter-reaction-9394716\">‘magic money tree’</a> in managing to pay 80% of salaries to furloughed workers, the self-employed and in funding the deferral of VAT payments. Clearly, it is possible for the state to spend money when it needs to. This is made even easier by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/commentisfree/2020/mar/08/with-borrowing-effectively-free-why-be-scared-of-government-debt\">record low interest rates</a> on Government bonds which effectively allow states (who control their currency) to print as much money as they like to invest and stimulate economic growth.&nbsp;<br>Therefore, there is actually the potential for this current economic crisis to lead to some genuinely positive changes in the way our economy is set up for the future. As <a href=\"https://tribunemag.co.uk/2020/04/after-coronavirus-theres-no-going-back-to-normal\">Brett writes</a>: “a new de-financialised structure of incentives can emerge to meet social, economic and environmental needs”.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/windfarm-1-1024x683.jpeg?resize=640%2C427\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-470\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/windfarm-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/windfarm-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/windfarm-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/windfarm-1.jpeg?resize=693%2C462&amp;ssl=1 693w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/windfarm-1.jpeg?resize=150%2C100&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/windfarm-1.jpeg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/windfarm-1.jpeg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Following in the footsteps of FDR, we can stimulate the economy by creating millions of well-paid jobs in the new <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/08/22/lack-green-tech-means-uk-will-miss-carbon-target-warn-mps/\">Green Technology sector</a> which is sadly lacking in the UK.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We can renationalise public services that are vital both inside and out of a global pandemic (this can include <a href=\"https://tribunemag.co.uk/2020/03/nationalise-the-airlines\">airlines</a> so badly in need of a government bailout that the state has incredible leverage to attach public ownership and strict environmental standards). We can actually <a href=\"https://tribunemag.co.uk/2020/03/why-we-need-economic-planning\">plan our economy</a>&#8211; getting us away from the <a href=\"https://novaramedia.com/2020/03/23/when-logistics-run-out-of-time/\">‘just in time’ model</a> which has left us so badly under-resourced during Coronavirus, enabling us to more fairly allocate resources amongst the public. We can implement a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f931514-e46e-11e9-b112-9624ec9edc59\">Universal Basic Income</a> which would allow no one to fall victim to such a crisis again, as well as helping us transition to a future of AI and automation. And, most importantly, we can prepare for the impending Climate disaster by launching a ‘<a href=\"https://novaramedia.com/2020/02/13/whats-the-deal-with-the-green-new-deal/\">Green New Deal</a>’. Following in the footsteps of FDR, we can stimulate the economy by creating millions of well-paid jobs in the new <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/08/22/lack-green-tech-means-uk-will-miss-carbon-target-warn-mps/\">Green Technology sector</a> which is sadly lacking in the UK.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, all these things are not going to happen by themselves. For a Conservative Government to take such measures would require an unprecedented level of public pressure in order to force their hand. But we have already seen that our narcissistic (but thankfully healthy) PM is somewhat responsive to public demands. As such, in addition to trying to improve conditions for NHS Staff, prevent more deaths from Covid-19, our efforts should turn to the future facing us after Coronavirus. After all, Cameron and Osborne have given us their <a href=\"https://tribunemag.co.uk/2020/04/after-coronavirus-theres-no-going-back-to-normal\">“template for how not to respond to a crisis”</a>.

I think my subconscious might be trying to tell me something about my own feelings towards the current lockdown but oh well… they are well worth reading! It is more understandable than ever to be feeling out of sorts in this very odd time and it is vital to find some light at the end of the tunnel. These books all tell amazing stories of resilience and courage in evocative, heart-wrenching and often darkly funny ways. I urge you to pick one up ASAP.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\"><strong><em>1. A Bit of A Stretch &#8211; Chris Atkins</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you think this is a guide to mastering your yogic downward-dog in quarantine I ask you to pause. Inhale. Exhale. And now realise that this book’s title actually refers to the tiny cell that Atkins occupied during his sentence at Her Majesty&#8217;s Prison Wandsworth. Having been caught up in an illegal scheme to fund his documentary making he finds himself saying goodbye to the outside world and his beloved son to serve his time. A fascinating and witty read for those who want to know more about day to day life in prison without having to break the law themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\"><strong><em>2.

This book does it all. Al Kadhi was brought up in an Iraqi-British Muslim household where their difference wasn’t exactly welcomed. Educated at Eton College then at Cambridge University we see the power and importance of finding your people and the necessity of kindness. They found their non gender binary identity and created their drag act, Glamrou at Cambridge but this did not end the impacts of previous traumas. Written with sincerity and clarity this book takes you on a journey of how two seemingly contradictory worlds can actually be  reconciled if we only learn to listen and accommodate a little more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\"><strong><em>3.

This book’s beautifully written prose, interspersed with poetry, rethinks the meaning of home and family and will leave you angry and sad at the injustice of what happened. Sometimes difficult to read but the current of hope that underpins his writing makes it well worth a read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\"><strong><em>4. Unfollow: A Journey From Hatred to Hope &#8211; Megan Phelps-Roper</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Westboro Baptists gained instant fame in Louis Theroux’s 2007 Documentary ‘The Most Hated Family In America’ in which Phelps-Roper was a central subject. A church who’s views on homosexuality and anti-semitism were indoctrinated into its members seemed stuck in the past. Written after she left the Westboro Baptists in 2012, we are given an extraordinary account of what it really means to leave everything and everyone you have ever known in order to seek your own truth. The courage needed to follow your&nbsp; convictions and start a new life is one to be marvelled at here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\"><strong><em>5.

Marnell takes you on a tour of her life starting at 26 years old when she was associate beauty editor at a top magazine. Unfortunately she was also &#8211; in her words &#8211; “a weepy, wobbly, wildly hallucination-prone insomniac; a tweaky self-mutilator; a slutty and self-loathing downtown party girl; and – perhaps most of all – a lonely weirdo.” Her deeply honest account on the impact of drug addiction on her own life and those around her makes for a gripping read.

As a professional sportsman, I am one of surprisingly few professions that find it totally impossible to do their jobs at home. You could argue that this isn’t actually true: my job is to train, which I can do, rather than play, which I can’t. But people don’t want to watch rugby players push weights around and run up and down lanes. Sport’s absence from the corona-world, so keenly felt by so many spectators, has had an even more drastic impact on its players.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BXK6QrRFjGk/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

To be honest, you’d be half right. My family haven’t spent an extended period of time together for as long as I can remember, we live in the countryside, and I am unable to provide much in the way of structure to a day that, by definition, can’t simply substitute an office space for a 9-5 presence on Zoom in my bedroom. A lot of a sportsman’s life is spent constantly striving for the one percenters that mark out improvement, perfecting a skill in training or synchronising perfectly with your team in an exceptional session, and there is certainly a part of me that misses those opportunities to better myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a lot of ways, though, lockdown has become somewhat of a sanctuary for me. I have struggled with depression for the last 18 months, and I firmly believe that this is in no small part due to a total lack of release from a permanently pressurised situation. Professional sport is, by its nature, competition personified: we compete against rival teams at the weekend, and then we compete&nbsp; against our teammates throughout the week to keep, or regain, spots in the team. I spent much of last year injured, in a personal battle against myself to find extras to do and come back stronger, and forwent my summer break to seek out more game time in South Africa, so I have not really had a break from this relentless train since I started professional rugby nearly two years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;In lockdown, however, I am only ‘competing’ with myself (still a formidable opponent for me), which I believe to be a much healthier recipe.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Lockdown has provided me, I think, with exactly the sort of space I need to try and get my head right. Various strategies presented themselves to me as coping mechanisms while playing this season, from writing daily goals down in a book and ticking them off, to daily meditation sessions upon waking up and before going to sleep. Switching off from the competitive environment completely was extremely difficult: despite finding my moments of stillness, I would then flip it completely on its head the next time I arrived at training. In lockdown, however, I am only ‘competing’ with myself (still a formidable opponent for me), which I believe to be a much healthier recipe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having more time to invest in myself and my mental well-being is something I am celebrating about the new status quo. Obviously, I miss my friends and personal contact deeply, and I can also confirm lockdown is not a good time to be single, but I find myself increasingly feeling ‘normal’ again after so long battling with myself on a daily basis. More time to meditate and do yoga has helped, as has having total control over my own schedule (something professional rugby is notoriously terrible at week to week). Nonetheless, taking a step back from worrying thoughts concerning work is a rare and celebrated side effect of our enforced quarantine, and I almost find myself wishing it will continue!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/yoga-1024x683.jpeg?resize=640%2C427\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-619\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/yoga.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/yoga.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/yoga.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/yoga.jpeg?resize=693%2C462&amp;ssl=1 693w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/yoga.jpeg?resize=150%2C100&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/yoga.jpeg?w=1050&amp;ssl=1 1050w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>&#8220;<em>More time to meditate and do yoga has helped, as has having total control over my own schedule</em>&#8220;</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So I would say to anyone who finds themselves furloughed, stuck at home, or just bored, have a dig around inside your head and investigate what has changed about their lives in quarantine. Are there things that make you feel better, or worse, and can you identify them effectively? Not only will it lead to a greater sense of self-awareness and understanding, but it will also hopefully allow you to recognise what makes you happy, and what makes you tick. Applying these principles to my work, when life finally returns to normal, is something I am genuinely excited about. I wouldn’t have had this time to reflect were it not for this lockdown, and while I am obviously aware of the vast damages it is doing to many facets of society, I fervently hope that those who read this can find something in their time away from the hectic pace of life to benefit them as individuals.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Will Wilson</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Tell your story &#8211; </em>s<em>tories@herdcommunity.co.uk</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-social-links aligncenter\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li class=\"wp-social-link wp-social-link-instagram\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/herd.uk\" aria-label=\"Instagram\"> <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\"><path d=\"M12,4.622c2.403,0,2.688,0.009,3.637,0.052c0.877,0.04,1.354,0.187,1.671,0.31c0.42,0.163,0.72,0.358,1.035,0.673 c0.315,0.315,0.51,0.615,0.673,1.035c0.123,0.317,0.27,0.794,0.31,1.671c0.043,0.949,0.052,1.234,0.052,3.637 s-0.009,2.688-0.052,3.637c-0.04,0.877-0.187,1.354-0.31,1.671c-0.163,0.42-0.358,0.72-0.673,1.035 c-0.315,0.315-0.615,0.51-1.035,0.673c-0.317,0.123-0.794,0.27-1.671,0.31c-0.949,0.043-1.233,0.052-3.637,0.052 s-2.688-0.009-3.637-0.052c-0.877-0.04-1.354-0.187-1.671-0.31c-0.42-0.163-0.72-0.358-1.035-0.673 c-0.315-0.315-0.51-0.615-0.673-1.035c-0.123-0.317-0.27-0.794-0.31-1.671C4.631,14.688,4.622,14.403,4.622,12 s0.009-2.688,0.052-3.637c0.04-0.877,0.187-1.354,0.31-1.671c0.163-0.42,0.358-0.72,0.673-1.035 c0.315-0.315,0.615-0.51,1.035-0.673c0.317-0.123,0.794-0.27,1.671-0.31C9.312,4.631,9.597,4.622,12,4.622 M12,3 C9.556,3,9.249,3.01,8.289,3.054C7.331,3.098,6.677,3.25,6.105,3.472C5.513,3.702,5.011,4.01,4.511,4.511 c-0.5,0.5-0.808,1.002-1.038,1.594C3.25,6.677,3.098,7.331,3.054,8.289C3.01,9.249,3,9.556,3,12c0,2.444,0.01,2.751,0.054,3.711 c0.044,0.958,0.196,1.612,0.418,2.185c0.23,0.592,0.538,1.094,1.038,1.594c0.5,0.5,1.002,0.808,1.594,1.038 c0.572,0.222,1.227,0.375,2.185,0.418C9.249,20.99,9.556,21,12,21s2.751-0.01,3.711-0.054c0.958-0.044,1.612-0.196,2.185-0.418 c0.592-0.23,1.094-0.538,1.594-1.038c0.5-0.5,0.808-1.002,1.038-1.594c0.222-0.572,0.375-1.227,0.418-2.185 C20.99,14.751,21,14.444,21,12s-0.01-2.751-0.054-3.711c-0.044-0.958-0.196-1.612-0.418-2.185c-0.23-0.592-0.538-1.094-1.038-1.594 c-0.5-0.5-1.002-0.808-1.594-1.038c-0.572-0.222-1.227-0.375-2.185-0.418C14.751,3.01,14.444,3,12,3L12,3z M12,7.378 c-2.552,0-4.622,2.069-4.622,4.622S9.448,16.622,12,16.622s4.622-2.069,4.622-4.622S14.552,7.378,12,7.378z M12,15 c-1.657,0-3-1.343-3-3s1.343-3,3-3s3,1.343,3,3S13.657,15,12,15z M16.804,6.116c-0.596,0-1.08,0.484-1.08,1.08 s0.484,1.08,1.08,1.08c0.596,0,1.08-0.484,1.08-1.08S17.401,6.116,16.804,6.116z\"></path></svg></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><span style=\"color:#5e656b\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Follow us on Instagram </span></em></h4>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/willwilson/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/71c440b8b052534ae7baff99f6a3d408?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Will Wilson\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/willwilson/\">Will Wilson</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Practicality, purpose, therapy, boredom, enjoyment. If you’re making exciting food, cooking is never a chore &#8211; it’s a lot more fun than our daily one-hour exercise allowance, because there’s good food at the end of this tunnel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a lot of us, we want cheap and easy meals that don’t take long and taste delicious. Not asking for much. While this sometimes seems like our choices are reduced to pesto pasta (a classic), something with toast as the main ingredient or a ready meal, this need not be the case.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this recipe might take a little longer than your microwaveable chicken katsu, we’re currently on lockdown, so time is not a valid excuse. Asian Meatballs are, in my opinion, one of the most underrated dishes of the 20th Century and you’ll thank me for them later&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"437\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-10.47.47.png?resize=640%2C437\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-10.47.47.png?w=711&amp;ssl=1 711w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-10.47.47.png?resize=300%2C205&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Time to get in your kitchens and start cooking up a storm. Feel free to share your creations with me on Instagram <strong>@socialdistancingkitchen </strong>and please follow and support my new business as it starts to (hopefully) grow! On the other hand, if you like the look of the meatballs but don’t like the thought of cooking, let us cook them for you! Below is a bit about what we do and how to get involved. Stay safe and stay full &#8211; the summer body can wait.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-7SpkyBapL/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

        "content": "\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Lost to many in the midst of the current crisis, Bernie Sanders announced the suspension of his campaign for President of the United States. This came as a shock to many as, despite the fact Sanders faced extremely tough odds to defeat Joe Biden in the Democratic Primary, the Coronavirus is revealing the severe and deadly costs of having an entirely for-profit healthcare system. Adding to this sad state-of-affairs, Bernie apparently failed to use the considerable leverage of his millions of passionate young activists to extract any concrete policy proposals, cabinet positions or anything of significance at all from the now presumptive Democratic nominee.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sanders’ campaign undoubtedly had an enormous effect on American politics which should be far-reaching and long-lasting. The Vermont Senator has shifted the ‘overton window’ (the space of reasonable political debate) far to the left since his original campaign for the White House launched in 2015. On policies such as <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/30/two-thirds-of-americans-favor-raising-federal-minimum-wage-to-15-an-hour/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">raising the minimum wage</a>, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/461106-majority-of-voters-support-free-college-eliminating-student-debt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tuition-Free-College</a> <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/480719-poll-narrow-majority-favors-medicare-for-all\">‘Medicare-For-All’</a> (a universal healthcare system) and the <a href=\"https://grist.org/article/poll-the-green-new-deal-is-as-popular-as-legalizing-weed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">‘Green New Deal’</a> plan to neutralise the Carbon-based economy and create millions of jobs, Sanders has managed to bring with him a vast majority of Democratic voters and even a majority of the American public. For this, Sanders will be remembered as a trail-blazer who stood up to the political, media and economic establishment- all in the face of numerous, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=74&amp;v=3ZhkKATtqtU\">unfounded attacks on his character</a> ( below). </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Rising Up | Bernie 2020\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ZhkKATtqtU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the campaign is now officially over and, for the second election in a row, the Democratic Party is nominating an ‘electable’ establishment centrist to take on Donald Trump- this time with the added bonus of said candidate being <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/04/19/837966525/on-the-record-a-former-biden-staffers-sexual-assault-allegation?t=1587314662913\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recently accused of sexual assault</a> and showing clear signs of <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/2020/03/15/establishment_dems_know_bidens_in_cognitive_decline_504533.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cognitive decline</a>. This is clearly to the detriment of the Democrats. This time four years ago, Hilary Clinton was heavily favoured to defeat Trump. Though by the time November came around voters found her brand of neoliberalism, mixed with incremental improvements, less palatable than the loud-mouthed populist Billionaire who now sits in the Oval Office. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Sanders’ 2020 campaign gained momentum prior to the crushing defeats in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday, political commentators around the globe looked forward to a monumental battle of Sanders vs. Trump. Not only between two extremely skillful politicians, both possessing an incredible ability to take the people with them on issues, but between two competing definitions of populism. In such a high-profile campaign for the highest office in the world, we would get to see two radically different, but equally interesting, visions of the future.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a bit of background, Cas Mudde provides a commonly-cited academic definition of populism as a ‘thin-centred ideology’ which seeks to create some notion of a division within society, between the ‘virtuous people and corrupt elites’. Being ‘thin-centred’ means that politicians wishing to portray such a divide would be able to attach this populist rhetoric onto their own politics. The ‘us vs. them’ dichotomy that populists create will vary significantly between party and country. Crucially though, the aim of <em>populism</em> is to be <em>popular</em>. Populist politicians aim to win over their publics by presenting ideas that will appeal to them, promising to improve their lives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In much of the world, populism is certainly on the rise. Since the 2008 Financial Crash, a defining moment in political history, millions if not billions of people have discovered that the current economic and political system is not working to their benefit. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/687c0184-aaa6-11e8-94bd-cba20d67390c\" target=\"_blank\">This has made populism</a> a far more attractive proposal. Creating an image of a ‘corrupt elite’ working to the detriment of the public is certainly a lot easier when living standards are declining, unemployment is rife and inequality is at its highest level in history. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;The Occupy movement, meanwhile, stated they were fighting for the 99%, railing against bankers and Wall Street executives who had profited whilst the rest of the Global Economy failed and ordinary people.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>On the left, this populist moment brought about the growth of parties such as Podemos in Spain, Syriza in Greece, the election- and initial success- of Jeremy Corbyn as Leader of the Labour Party- as well as the growth of extra-parliamentary movements such as Occupy. These left-wing populists framed their campaigns as being on the side of ‘the people’, that their platform would fix the inherent corruption in the political economy of their countries which had only been to the benefit of the ultra-wealthy. Corbyn, for example, famously used as his 2017 campaign slogan, ‘For the Many, Not the Few’. The Occupy movement, meanwhile, stated they were fighting for the 99%, railing against bankers and Wall Street executives who had profited whilst the rest of the Global Economy failed and ordinary people. And it was this rhetoric which Sanders channelled during his mass rallies, calling out the ‘millionaires and billionaires’, ‘the 1%’, or ‘1 tenth of 1%’.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, there are those such as Matteo Salvini in Italy, Nigel Farage in the UK, Bolsonaro in Brazil and, obviously Trump in America- who have a very different conception of who makes up the ‘people and the elites’. Those on the right of the political spectrum have generally tended to frame politics around cultural issues including immigration and crime. The dichotomy of ‘us vs. them’ is often presented on ethno-cultural grounds, creating a mythological conception of the nation state as the ‘heartland’ which automatically excludes immigrants, and those members of the ‘metropolitan liberal elite’ who are supposedly working to the detriment of ‘the people’. Recent right-wing populists have presented themselves as being able to fix their country by actually adhering to the will of the people- closing borders, putting national citizens first, and being tough on crime.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump himself largely ran in 2016 on the promises of ‘building a wall’, banning Muslims from entering America, renegotiating foreign trade deals, and cutting taxes whilst also pledging to protect Social Security which so many older Americans rely on. Interestingly, Trump represents a clear break with Republican ideology in some respects- notably in respect to trade where he supports a more protectionist approach as opposed to laissez-faire free trade deals supported by previous GOP administrations. This runs parallel to Sanders’ campaign on the Democratic side which broke with orthodoxy to call for ‘deep, structural change’ as opposed to incremental improvements. Both men have certainly shifted opinions within their own parties, making it far more difficult for future candidates to go back to the pre-2016 neoliberal status-quo.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially key with these populist movements, is bringing people into politics who had previously felt left out by the system. Often this has been done by speaking as clearly and colloquially as possible in order to appeal to ‘the ordinary people’ within society. This is something Sanders and Trump both achieved to great affect. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/it-s-not-just-bros-sanders-wins-diverse-coalition-n1141251\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sanders brought in millions of young people, African-Americans and Hispanics into his voter base</a> with his positive message offering solutions to issues of healthcare provision, environmental decline, low wages and a lack of adequate housing. Trump meanwhile, was incredibly successful in mobilising millions of low-income, white working-class Americans with his plan to ‘Make America Great Again’. Both men offer a great insight into <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16S2lQn5xgs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">political linguistics</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aFo_BV-UzI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">argumentation</a> which certainly deserve more comprehensive scrutiny and discussion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Politically though, the debates between Trump and Sanders would have put these competing definitions of populism on centre-stage. The battle to frame the causes and solutions of the problems facing ordinary Americans would not only have been incredibly fun to watch, but would have had far-reaching consequences worldwide. This was to be a potential defining moment for deciding what kind of society we want to live in. Should nation states open their borders or be closed-off to the rest of the world? Should we change the way our economy works to battle climate change? Should we tackle crime through harsher sentencing or rehabilitation? Do people of differing races, gender identities, sexualities and religions have more in common than not? All in all, do the public value economic populism or cultural populism? Or, as Rosa Luxemburg famously said: “Socialism or Barbarism”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, the world is now missing out on such a debate. It is my belief that ‘the left’ and Bernie would’ve won this fight. Whether that’s true or not, from a pure sociological perspective, the world is missing out by not having this most important of discussions out in the open in a battle to lead the ‘free world’. Unfortunately, the comedy value of getting to watch an adderall-fueled Trump obliterate a barely comprehensible Biden in front of millions of people will have to do.</p>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/glynsheldon/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b6f4eedcc4559f94dd10458b659bb94a?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Glyn Sheldon\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/glynsheldon/\">Glyn Sheldon</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

However, a virtual dinner party is pencilled in, and for me this is completely new territory. I realised that this time, it&#8217;s not only the host who must lay and prepare the table, but also us guests. So I better get making that setting for one…</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enough with my old table setting ways, it&#8217;s time to spruce things up a bit!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have&nbsp;you ever heard of ‘table scaping’? Neither had I until recently and this is a phrase that has become increasingly popular, from designers to chefs to the perfect host. Tablescaping is the idea that you are dressing your table and place settings up for an event or dinner, and now we have the excuse to practice what we preach and experiment with tablescaping, just for our own satisfaction. Even though we&#8217;re all enjoying the comforts of wearing loungewear at home, there are a few of us who are starting to miss getting dressed up, so why not turn this energy into your table settings?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A whole host of online influencers have been turning their focus onto this over the past few weeks, with their aesthetically pleasing dinners flowing onto our Instagram feeds daily. However beautiful these may be, we might not have the same collection of unique and interesting pieces to recreate them – well I definitely don’t! However, we can still use colours and textures that make us happy to create our own inspiring setting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once we have picked our theme, we can start to collect items to fill the space. I have chosen the colour yellow as my focus and I want to bring in lots of fruits to fill the table as well. Secondly, we need to collect several of the following for our place settings (depending on the occasion of course); tablecloth, placemat, large plate, small plate, napkin and then any greenery or decoration. This may seem a bit over the top for a casual dinner, so these pieces can be removed and altered to suit the mood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the scarcity of my resources, colour is lacking a little so I&#8217;m planning to get seriously inventive with my decoration. My plan is to gather pieces of greenery from outside to scatter on the table, light an array of candles and add a variety flowers into vases, bottles, jam jars or anything else I can find!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If like me, you&#8217;re very much a beginner and need all the inspiration you can get, there&#8217;s tonnes of cool Instagram accounts that can help put the imagination into overdrive. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-KXlR_p80C/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

But can buying something new, whatever it may be, really make you that much happier? (Suppose it depends what it is!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t want to end up coming out of lockdown with a collection of new clothes that we don’t actually need, and inevitably will end up in landfill in the next few years, oh and less money for those post lockdown celebrations. So I have devised my key tips n tricks and what I use to decide if I really ‘need’ anything new. Hopefully this gives a helping hand as I know majority of my friends, myself included are turning to the comfort of retail therapy..</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/RetailTherapy--1024x683.jpeg?resize=640%2C427\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-599\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/RetailTherapy--scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/RetailTherapy--scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/RetailTherapy--scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/RetailTherapy--scaled.jpeg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/RetailTherapy--scaled.jpeg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>1.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When I do end up having a quick online browse and find something I love, I add it to my basket and then sit on it. Over the next few days if I am still convinced I ‘need’ those pair of jeans then I will continue to purchase, but more often than not I end up forgetting about the shopping basket and that pair of blue boyfriend jeans.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>2.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The One in One out policy. So for example your cream jumper shrunk in the wash? Perfect! You are ‘allowed’ to buy another cream jumper. You did a clear out and got rid out three white shirts? Perfect! You may buy a new white shirt. Another example could be you want to follow the latest trends and this season you decide to invest in that trench coat, but you do not already have a trench coat in the wardrobe. Then fear not all you need to do is have a rummage through items you already own to see if you can either sell or donate something else.  It is easier said than done but if I can manage to let pieces go then so can you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>3.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I also try to imagine my wardrobe at home and then I think of three ways I can wear the item. You want to buy something with versatility, and something you will wear continuously – remember cost per wear! This is a big lesson I learnt while doing the lockdown clear out is that I get bored of pieces way too quickly. Resulting in me vowing to put everything to the test from now on and make sure that my new purchase will keep me clothed for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>4.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, if your desired piece has reached this far then always a phone call to best friend, family or loved one for an honest opinion. For me I always ask my mum and helpfully she holds nothing back. Voila, decision made!</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-center\"><p>&#8220;Don’t get me wrong I love a good bargain but its time to be a lot more economically conscious&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I already feel these few steps have made a massive difference in my level of consumption and allowed me to use what I already have instead of turning to a cheap and accessible next day delivery buy. Don’t get me wrong I love a good bargain but its time to be a lot more economically conscious! Remember that 300,000 tonnes of clothes worth £12.5 billion get dumped into landfill yearly, and it is only increasing. So every little helps.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Annabel Rodick</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" rel=\"http://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/ \">Home</a></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/annabelrodick/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6d9addfa1f255d42b5aa03d2a17d8dc0?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Annabel Rodick\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/annabelrodick/\">Annabel Rodick</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Seems counterintuitive, right? Let&#8217;s delve into it. I&#8217;ll be briefly discussing why I believe appreciation is better than gratitude</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of us were raised to believe that gratitude and appreciation are the same thing. Not entirely. I look at it like this: Gratitude is the training wheels and appreciation is when you take the training wheels off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Appreciation is about living in the present. When you appreciate something, there is no cloudiness stemming from the past. All of your feelings are drawn from the now. It&#8217;s a feeling that naturally springs from within. This is the way to truly live without fear and limitations. The air of security and attentiveness it brings you can be sensed and acknowledged by those around you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gratitude, on the other hand, carries the signature of past struggles we&#8217;ve overcome. The feeling of gratefulness always involves something or someone else. It&#8217;s as if you&#8217;re forced to feel it due to a favourable outcome that exceeded your expectations</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>for e.g. I am grateful for someone for having taken care of me, but I appreciate the serenity of my home this morning&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Why is it important to distinguish between the two</strong>?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Every action you take creates your memories and shapes your tomorrow. The universe holds your desires until you&#8217;re ready to claim it, but you must release yourself from the shackles of the past. Or maybe there&#8217;s a machine that can change the past that I don&#8217;t know about? I didn&#8217;t think so either.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;When you are blinded, you have no sense of direction.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Gratitude is necessary and natural, but it&#8217;s important not to hold onto it for too long. Holding onto past situations, good or bad, can blind you to the growth that&#8217;s taken place in the now. When you are blinded, you have no sense of direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good method I use to make peace with the past is to practice the 48 hour rule. Put simply, I don&#8217;t dwell on wins or losses for longer than 48 hours. What&#8217;s done is done and there&#8217;s absolutely nothing any of us can do to change it. Staying consistent with this practice has allowed me to always be looking forward to the next challenge, which keeps me in a state of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://moeyinmotion.com/the-essence-of-giving/\">giving</a>&nbsp;and receiving.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Moey</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/moeyinmotion/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7cd997919cfea15e959635b2ec16f0f3?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Moey\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/moeyinmotion/\">Moey</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

Recycling was introduced into UK law in 2003, after years of campaigning by&nbsp;NGOs such as Friends of the Earth. Before that, only 12% of our municipal waste was recycled, when an average of 60% could actually be reused or composted (One of the worst in Western Europe!).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recycling is a common part of our daily lives here in the UK, and most people try and do their bit to stick with the rules.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the rules are a bit complex and do’s and don’ts have become blurred as different regulations apply to different parts of the country. This is the result of the government not providing enough overarching guidance, so local authorities and councils have to take it into their own hands. Therefore the approach to recycling depends on money and the infrastructure of the area.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Why do we recycle?&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This may seem like a stupid question, but I have found that our reason for recycling has been somewhat lost, and now it feels more like a burden than something practical.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, recycling stops a lot of our waste going to landfill. So to some extent it aims to directly protect the planet from littering and reduces the numbers of big nasty piles of rubbish. I think we can all agree that sounds like a positive plan, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recycling also helps us reduce the quantity of resources that we take from the earth, as we try and reuse the materials we have already extracted. The earth has only a limited supply of resources that we can and have exploited for our consumer habits, but also it must be remembered that the earth is not here to fulfill the needs of human shopping habits.&nbsp;Meanwhile, sustainable behaviour does not have to be treated as burdensome, and when executed correctly, can provide jobs to a newly skilled labour fore.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>How can we recycle better?&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite there being a great deal of disparity between different recycling schemes in different areas, there are some overriding rules that you can follow to make sure that your recycling isn’t going to waste.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Wash</strong> &#8211; If there is food waste on a recycled it’s not going to be recycled &#8211; EVER- NO EXCEPTIONS. Easy solution, give those cans a little rinse. Doesn’t have to be squeaky clean, so no need to put in the dishwasher. </li><li><strong>Squash</strong> &#8211; Once you’ve rinsed your precious piece of recycling, if it’s a tin can or a plastic bottle, or cardboard box, squash it. This will reduce the volume of recycling and also the risk of contamination. </li><li><strong>Caps, Lids and Rings</strong>&#8211; Remove and throw away ANY PLASTIC CAPS and LIDS. (Plastic rings around the top of bottles can stay if you CBA.) </li><li><strong>Paperclips, Staples, Plastic Envelope Windows- </strong>REMOVE THESE TOO, and THROW AWAY! (Inc. Tape from cardboard boxes) </li><li><strong>PIZZA BOXES- </strong>If they have food/ grease stains on them… THEY CANT BE RECYCLED. </li></ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BxhZxU7BpSP/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

The best example of this is obviously buying fresh, loose fruit and veg and trying to shop seasonally. Often seasonal and local produce is easier to source plastic free! We can also try and find alternatives that mean we don’t have to throw so much crap away in the first place!!</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Own a water bottle</li><li>Own a coffee cup&nbsp;</li><li>Buy locally &#8211; support local butcher, green grocer and zero waste shop (if there is one near&nbsp; you)&nbsp;</li><li>Composting &#8211; <strong><em>Check council composting&nbsp;</em></strong></li><li>Eco bricks&nbsp;</li><li>Taking your own Tupperware to the supermarket &#8211; so if you buy meat, fish or cheese or bread from the different areas you can have it straight in your own box/bag.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The point that always gets overlooked is that recycling isn’t the only, best or easiest option to reduce waste/ impact on the planet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But without us all trying to recycle properly or later on buying things that are made from the recycled resources the effort that we make can become futile. To make your domestic efforts and the efforts of the council worthwhile, a conscious effort needs to be made to purchase recycled products&#8230;e.g. Loo Roll made from recycled paper (<em>Who Gives a Crap</em> Loo Roll).</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Lucy Browne-Swinburne</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/lucybs/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7ef5fb37ab7dc72129bebd2ff4f1203b?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Lucy Browne-Swinburne\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/lucybs/\">Lucy Browne-Swinburne</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

During this time, I have had the pleasure of wearing a random assortment of loungewear from my wardrobe every day. The comfier alternative to my usual weekly attire has definitely been a treat, but wearing wearing an old school jumper and running leggings doesn’t exactly scream &#8216;Friday feeling&#8217;, does it? I must admit, I miss the Friday morning struggle to pull together an outfit suitable for both breakfast and dinner, trying to make that balance of desk to drinks… surely I am not the only person who does this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this in mind, we shouldn’t be looking to buy loungewear online anymore, instead turning our focus to those summer days approaching. Treating ourselves to a new summer-inspired piece to love and give us a feeling of excitement and positivity. Whilst the chance of wearing these clothes outdoors remains unassured, a hopeful mindset provides a refreshing break from the ordinary during these times. The same feeling you get when you find that perfect outfit for a big event or party &#8211; it makes you that tiny bit more excited, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-21-at-18.01.46.png?resize=640%2C416&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-681\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-21-at-18.01.46.png?resize=1024%2C666&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-21-at-18.01.46.png?resize=300%2C195&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-21-at-18.01.46.png?resize=768%2C499&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-21-at-18.01.46.png?w=1092&amp;ssl=1 1092w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>With AW20 collections in full flow,  colourful and inspiring summer pieces are now fully immersed in our online shopping feeds. The runway was filled with warm sunset tones of pink, red and orange, and has since begun to radiate our wardrobes with joyous colour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, those who may naturally shy away from a brighter colour palette are also well suited as more neutral, calming hues were also very prominent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all those polka dot lovers out there &#8211; this is your time. The pattern was echoed continuously on the catwalk and can easily be transferred into everyday life. Admittedly, this is not my favourite design but that&#8217;s the beauty of fashion, you wear what makes you happy and since there are a multitude of trends per season, you have the privilege to pick and choose what you like!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Check Mate</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Check mate. That’s right, checks are in too. Big checks, little checks, whatever you fancy and the beauty of this print is that lots of us might have some of it stored away in the loft or stuffed at the back of the wardrobe. It may not be that chic piece you are looking for, but nothing a pair of scissors and a needle and thread can’t change. Whenever I find old fabric, I tear off a strip and whip it in my hair, or since we have a bit more time on our hands, perhaps add some elastic to make a scrunchie?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To top it off sequins were seen EVERYWHERE, and it is time to get that shine on. Bring out those pieces stored away for the festive season or invest in a little more sparkle. This may be a bit daring for some but I promise by adding a bit of a twinkle, your outfit won’t just brighten up but also you day. Is it crazy to envisage that once we are back to reality everyone will be so ready to dress up again that we will be OTT 7 days a week? If not, that solves my Friday morning dilemmas, sparkles to work it is!</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Annabel Rodick</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"http://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/annabelrodick/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6d9addfa1f255d42b5aa03d2a17d8dc0?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Annabel Rodick\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/annabelrodick/\">Annabel Rodick</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",

With it I taught myself how to sew, I made presents for friends and family and most importantly I gave myself the ability and freedom to be creative and the power to up-cycle. Much to my despair it broke a fortnight ago and straight away I got in contact with the Brother helpline. They were quick and helpful, and before I knew it I had packed up my little one year old machine and sent it off to be fixed</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I was reunited with the machine. When I opened up the box however, I realised that it was not the machine that I had waved good bye to a few days before, but a new machine…a stranger masquerading as my old, faithful friend. I had been sent a brand new machine. This one looks like the old one, but smells like plastic bags that threaten to suffocate babies and tiny pieces of tape that might one day wash up on the shores of Madagascar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"307\" height=\"230\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-1.png?resize=307%2C230\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-394\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-1.png?w=307&amp;ssl=1 307w, https://i1.wp.com/www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-1.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 307px) 100vw, 307px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><em>&#8220;A stranger masquerading as my old, faithful friend&#8221;</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember the old one, I’d kept the box so I could take it back to university with me, and then hopefully on to my first flat, and it would be waiting for me when I got home from my first job. I had planned for it to be there when I needed an escape, when I wanted to be busy and I wanted to create something all on my own. I thought that it would come with me to all the places I would one day call home, and I’d use it to fix and embellish the things that I loved.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately I also assumed that I’d be able to trust some one else to know the value of it, that they would know that it was a really important tool in my life, and that it needed fixing so that we could spend the rest of our lives together. I was a fool to assume that this disposable world would make an effort to salvage the life of this machine. ‘It would not be <em>economically viable</em> to fix the machine’. I can hear the customer services explanation ringing around my head… ‘Are you concerned about land fill and that?’… ‘don’t worry it gets disposed of properly..’.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;I thought they were going to fix my friend, and my creative partner. But they didn’t, they ‘disposed of her properly’. Someone else made a decision to scrap something very important to me, because of how much it would cost to fix.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it is not environmentally viable to make decisions like that without informing the owner of the machine, and that is the epitome of the place we live in today. We have a lot of fixing to do, and it’s going to cost us a lot of time and money, and many of the luxuries that come with that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to start dealing with problems and not avoiding them. This is not a sentimental eulogy to my sewing machine, this is a metaphor for our faulty attitude towards the earths resources and that is the problem that really needs fixing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Lucy Browne-Swinburne</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\" href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/\" style=\"border-radius:11px\" rel=\"www.herdcommunity.co.uk noopener noreferrer\">Home</a></div>\n<div class=\"uwp_widgets uwp_widget_author_box bsui sdel-fa446a3f\" ><div class=\"d-block text-center text-md-left d-md-flex p-3 bg-light\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/lucybs/\"><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7ef5fb37ab7dc72129bebd2ff4f1203b?s=96&r=g&d=https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/userswp/assets/images/no_profile.png\" class=\"rounded-circle shadow border border-white border-width-4 mr-3\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"Lucy Browne-Swinburne\"></a>\n  <div class=\"media-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"mt-0\">Author: <a href=\"https://www.herdcommunity.co.uk/profile/lucybs/\">Lucy Browne-Swinburne</a></h5>\n    \n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div></div>",
